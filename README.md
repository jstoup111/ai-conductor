# James Stoup Agents

A custom development harness for Claude Code. Pure Markdown skills and agent personas that enforce
a disciplined SDLC: design docs, user stories with mandatory negative paths, conflict detection,
TDD with domain review, evaluator-gated code review, and dual retrospectives.

No custom runtime. Claude Code is the execution engine.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/.docs/claude-code) v2.0+
- Git
- A project to work on (Rails+PostgreSQL has full tech-context support; other stacks work with generic skills)

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jstoup111/ai-conductor.git
cd ai-conductor
./bin/install
```

This symlinks all 20 skills into `~/.claude/skills/` and installs the conductor CLI(s) to
`~/.local/bin/`. See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for the full install
walkthrough (Mermaid renderer setup, verify/update/uninstall, worktree-root guard) and
[Choosing a Conductor](docs/choosing-a-conductor.md) for the `conduct` vs `conduct-ts`
comparison — both binaries coexist, `conduct` is the default, `conduct-ts` is opt-in.

## How the Pieces Fit Together

Three cooperating roles drive every feature from idea to merged PR — the **engineer**
(spec authoring), the **daemon** (autonomous build), and the **operator** (judgment +
merges). GitHub issues/PRs are the coordination medium; the daemon never merges.

```

- **Engineer**: turns a captured issue into a buildable spec (plan, stories, ADRs) and
  lands it as a spec PR. Investigation lives here — intake stays a plain symptom capture.
- **Daemon**: drains merged specs in priority order, builds each in an isolated worktree
  through the full SDLC, gated on completion by `build_review`'s LLM-judged completeness
  rubric (plan-vs-diff, fail-closed, self-heals via kickback), self-heals stalls and red CI,
  and opens the implementation PR with a committed shipped-record so the work is never
  re-dispatched.
- **Operator**: the only merger. Approves intake priorities, resolves halts the machinery
  escalates, and signs off version bumps.

## Quick Start

### Interactive (recommended for first use)

```bash
cd your-project/
claude
```

Then in the Claude Code session:

```
/conduct
```

The conductor checks artifact state, tells you what to run next, and blocks when gates aren't met.
It walks you through all 18 steps:

```
/bootstrap → /explore (track) → /prd (product track) → /architecture-diagram
→ /architecture-review → /stories → /conflict-check → /plan
→ /writing-system-tests → /pipeline → /manual-test
→ /prd-audit (product track) → /architecture-review --as-built → /retro → /finish
```

### Automated

```bash
cd your-project/

# The inline pipeline runs under the `inline` subcommand (foreground; the
# counterpart to the background `daemon`).

# Fully automated — walk away and come back
conduct inline --auto "URL shortener with click tracking"

# Default — auto with interactive recovery on failure
conduct inline "Add user authentication"

# Manual oversight — REPL mode for conversational steps (explore, prd, stories, plan, architecture_review, manual_test)
conduct inline --interactive "Payment processing"
```

```bash
conduct --status          # Check progress (shows all 16 steps)
conduct --resume          # Pick up where you left off
conduct --step stories    # Run one step only
conduct --from plan       # Start from a specific step
conduct --reset           # Clear session state and start fresh
```

Daemon mode (`conduct-ts` only) — drive many pre-specced features unattended, each in its
own worktree, opening a PR on finish:

```bash
# Drain the backlog once: every eligible feature, then exit
conduct-ts daemon

# Cap at 10 features this pass
conduct-ts daemon --max-items 10

# Continuous: keep polling for new features, bounded by ceilings
conduct-ts daemon --continuous --max-runtime 3600 --max-cost 2000000
```

Daemon flags: `--continuous` (idle-poll instead of draining once),
`--max-items <n>`, `--max-cost <tokens>`, `--max-runtime <seconds>`,
`--idle-poll <seconds>`, `--max-idle-polls <n>`. Ceilings stop *starting* new
features; in-flight work always drains. The daemon runs **serially** (one feature
at a time) so the live session shows exactly the feature building — `--concurrency`
above 1 is clamped to 1 with a logged note (real concurrency is out of scope; see
`.docs/plans/2026-06-29-daemon-tmux-supervisor.md`).

**Finish-choice recording (`finish-record`).** The daemon's auto-mode finish step
records its outcome by shelling out to a dedicated subcommand rather than writing
`.pipeline/finish-choice` by hand:

```bash
conduct-ts finish-record --choice pr --pr-url <url> --pipeline-dir <abs-path>
conduct-ts finish-record --choice keep --pipeline-dir <abs-path>
```

- `--choice pr|keep` — `pr` (requires `--pr-url <url>`) verifies the PR exists and
  that `HEAD` was pushed before recording `pr_url` into `conduct-state.json` and
  writing the marker; `keep` writes the marker only.
- `--pipeline-dir <abs-path>` is required and must be an absolute, existing
  directory.
- **Fail-closed:** any gate failure (bad flags, unverifiable PR, unpushed `HEAD`,
  corrupt state, etc.) exits 1 and writes nothing.

It's invoked by the daemon's auto-mode finish step (`src/conductor/src/engine/step-runners.ts`)
and can also be run manually in place of hand-editing the marker. See
`src/conductor/README.md` for full detail.

**Manual-test recording (`manual-test-record`, #385).** The daemon's auto-mode
had no way to record a `manual_test` outcome — only an interactive operator
could write the completion marker, so unattended builds HALTed at that step.
A dedicated subcommand records the outcome instead:

```bash
conduct-ts manual-test-record --skip --reason <r> --pipeline-dir <abs-path>
conduct-ts manual-test-record --results <path> --pipeline-dir <abs-path>
```

- `--skip --reason <r>` writes a fresh `<!-- manual-test:skipped -->` SKIP
  sentinel into the results file; `--results <path>` (or `--results -` for
  stdin) appends an attempt section with the actual test results.
- `--pipeline-dir <abs-path>` is required and must be an absolute, existing
  directory.
- **Fail-closed:** malformed flags (e.g. `--skip` paired with `--results`, a
  missing `--reason`, a relative `--pipeline-dir`) refuse before any write.
- The `manual_test` completion predicate accepts a **fresh** SKIP sentinel as
  done, with FAIL-precedence (a FAIL row recorded after the sentinel always
  wins) and anti-laundering guards (a stale or backdated sentinel does not
  satisfy the gate) — see `src/conductor/README.md` for the predicate's full
  ordering rules.
- `manual_test` is now S-tier skippable: a skipped step satisfies downstream
  `prd_audit` prerequisites the same way a completed one does.

It's invoked by the daemon's auto-mode dispatch in place of hand-writing the
marker, and can also be run manually. See `src/conductor/README.md` for full
detail.

**Finish-step engine completion machinery (#499, ADR D1-D5).** The finish step's
presentation-branch gate now includes several deterministic engine-side mechanisms to repair
stale PR state, verify draft-readiness, and handle surgical retries (all fail-open on errors):

1. **Order-gated in-step presentation repair** — The completion predicate verifies
   non-presentation conditions first (valid `finish-choice`, recorded `pr_url`, push
   evidence), then invokes repair (`rehabilitateHaltPr`, undraft, unlabel, retitle, Closes
   injection) **before** evaluating presentation conditions (title, draft). A finishing
   attempt that fails on recording/push evidence never clears `needs-remediation` signals,
   so redispatch and reconciliation keep working.

2. **Deterministic retitle-floor** — If the recorded PR's title still starts with
   `needs-remediation:`, the engine rewrites it to `feat: <feature_desc>` (fallback: branch
   name). The `/pr` skill's prose rewrite is the quality path; the floor only fires when the
   agent dropped the rewrite (prefix-gated), logged, and any later `/pr` pass improves it.

3. **Draft-readiness check (`isDraft`)** — The finish predicate reads `gh pr view isDraft`
   and rejects ship-readiness if the recorded PR is still draft (issue #439). Draft removal
   is handled by the in-step repair's `ensureShipReady` call.

4. **Surgical finish-record retry** — When recording is the only missing piece (`.finish-choice`
   or `pr_url` absent/stale) and every other condition holds, the engine retries with a
   narrow prompt naming just `conduct-ts finish-record --pipeline-dir <path>`, not the full
   ~10-minute finish skill re-walk.

5. **Engine behavior documentation** — `finish/SKILL.md` and `pr/SKILL.md` now document
   the engine's presentation repairs (undraft, unlabel, Closes, draft flip) as executed
   machinery, resolving the prior contradiction between the two skills. The agent-owned
   prose rewrite instruction remains (with the retitle-floor as backstop).

## How It Works

### SDLC Flow

```
UNDERSTAND → DECIDE → BUILD → SHIP
```

| Phase | Skills | What Happens |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| UNDERSTAND | `/bootstrap`, `/memory`, `/assess` | Detect/scaffold project, load tech-context, recall prior decisions, codebase health assessment |

### Agent Personas

Skills define *what* to do. Agents define *who* does it with what context.

| Agent | Role | Key Trait |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Generator | Writes tests and code | Context-isolated: RED sees only tests, GREEN sees only source |
| Evaluator | Reviews with skepticism | Fresh context, no shared state with generator |
| Domain Reviewer | Checks domain integrity | Veto authority — can reject and send back |
| Planner | Expands requirements | Surfaces edge cases the user didn't consider |
| Worktree Manager | Git worktree lifecycle | Feature isolation via create/merge/cleanup/status |
| CTO Security | Auth & input validation | OWASP top 10, attack vector analysis |
| CTO Data Integrity | Transactions & race conditions | Event sourcing, data safety |
| CTO Dependencies | Package & license auditing | CVEs, outdated packages, license compliance |
| CTO Architecture | Coherence & coupling | Decisions vs implementation alignment |
| CTO Duplication | Code duplication detection | Boilerplate, copy-paste, blast radius |
| CTO Testing | Test strategy review | Coverage gaps, layer balance, assertion quality |
| CTO Infrastructure | Infra config review | DB pooling, caching, background jobs, prod parity |
| CTO Observability | Logging & monitoring | Error handling, debugging context |
| CTO DevEx | Developer experience | Onboarding, CI/CD, local dev, documentation |
| CTO Orchestrator | Synthesizes 9 specialist reports | Cross-references and prioritizes findings |

### Enforcement Levels

| Level | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Advisory | Instructions only | Brainstorm: "ask one question at a time" |
| Gating | Evidence required | Stories: no story accepted without concrete negative paths |
| Structural | Subagent isolation | TDD: RED agent can't see source files |
| Mechanical | Git hooks (opt-in) | Pre-commit: block commits outside COMMIT phase |

### Tech-Context

Stack-specific knowledge in `tech-context/`. Currently supported:

| Stack | Context Files |
|-------|--------------|
| Rails + PostgreSQL | `tdd.md` (RSpec, factories), `stories.md` (N+1, migrations, enums), `review.md` (security, performance), `debugging.md` (tools, gotchas) |

Tech-context is additive — it supplements skills, never overrides them. Projects without matching
tech-context use generic skill behavior.

## TypeScript Conductor (`src/conductor/`)

The TypeScript rewrite behind `conduct-ts`. Three-layer architecture —
Engine / Execution / UI — with typed events, pluggable UI renderers, and
dedicated test coverage (950+ tests). See the feature comparison in
[Choosing a Conductor](#choosing-a-conductor); implementation notes below.

- **`bin/conduct-ts`** is a thin shell wrapper around `src/conductor/dist/index.js`.
- **Engine** owns state machine, gates, completion checks, auto-heal logic.
- **Execution** invokes Claude via `execa` with session + rate-limit handling.
- **UI** is a pluggable subscriber: the default terminal renderer is event-driven.
- **Auto-heal**: before a build-gate retry, the engine cross-checks
  `.pipeline/task-status.json` against git log and flips pending tasks to completed
  when there's unambiguous evidence of a prior-run commit. Audit trail under
  `.pipeline/audit-trail/autoheal-*.json`.
- **Bootstrap-mode skip**: when bootstrap detects a `new`-mode project (empty directory
  before scaffolding), the conductor skips `assess` rather than dispatching 9 specialists
  against a blank codebase.
- **Gate-driven loop**: the SHIP-phase tail (`build → manual_test → retro → rebase → finish`)
  is driven by a *selector* over machine-checkable **gate verdicts** rather than a fixed
  order. A downstream step can **kick back** to `plan`/`stories` (re-open an upstream gate);
  the loop converges to `.pipeline/DONE` or stops at `.pipeline/HALT`. Opt-in via
  `verifyArtifacts`; every step runs on a fresh LLM session (unconditional).
- **Judgement gate at the build → manual_test seam** (`build_review`, opt-in via
  `build_review.enabled: true`): a fresh-session, input-starved Opus grader sits between
  `build` and `manual_test`, recording an objective PASS/FAIL verdict on the diff before it
  reaches the more expensive manual-test step. A FAIL kicks back to `build` with the
  reasons (bounded retries, then HALT); absent config preserves the legacy
  `build → manual_test` topology unchanged. See `src/conductor/README.md` → "Judgement gate
  at the build → manual_test seam" for config, cap/HALT behavior, and the cost trade-off.
  SHIP-tail verdict checks (`build_review`, `prd_audit`, `architecture_review_as_built`)
  require their verdict artifact's mtime to be fresh relative to the **per-attempt** judging
  session (`attemptStartedAt`), not just the conductor-run start (`sessionStartedAt`) — a
  re-dispatched judging session that fails to rewrite its verdict file scores "no fresh
  verdict" instead of silently re-scoring a prior attempt's verdict forever.
- **Code-validity verdict preservation on re-dispatch/resume** (#817): those same judged
  gates (`build_review`, `prd_audit`, `architecture_review_as_built`, `manual_test`) also
  validate against **current code state**, not just evidence-file timestamp. Each `PASS`
  verdict is stamped with the HEAD SHA it was judged against; when a feature is
  re-dispatched or resumed and the code under that gate's declared surface (`GATE_SURFACE`)
  is unchanged since the stamp, the verdict is preserved and the gate is skipped instead of
  re-run — so a re-dispatched feature no longer re-pays a completed, still-valid judged gate
  (e.g. the ~17 min `build_review`) purely because the evidence file predates the new
  session. A stamped baseline that is missing, unreachable (rebase/reset-orphaned), or whose
  delta can't be computed always falls back to re-running (fail-closed). Opt-out via the
  additive `gate_code_validity.enabled` config key (default `true`); setting it `false`
  restores exact pre-feature mtime-only behavior. See `src/conductor/README.md` and
  `.docs/decisions/adr-2026-07-22-gate-evidence-code-validity-on-redispatch.md`.
- **Wiring reachability gate** (`wiring_check`, gating, always-on, all tiers): sits strictly
  between `build_review` and `manual_test` (`build → build_review → wiring_check →
  manual_test → ...`), verifying that new production surface is actually *called*, not just
  built and tested. Each plan task declares a `**Wired-into:** ` line (declared call
  site(s), `same as Task N`, `none (no new production surface)`, or a waived `none (inert
  until <ref>)` — full grammar in `skills/plan/SKILL.md` §5c); the gate cross-references
  those declarations against the diff's new exports (universal reference-scan Layer 1,
  plus an opt-in TypeScript import-graph reachability Layer 2 via `wiring.entry_points`
  config). Plans with zero `Wired-into:` lines predate the convention and get
  advisory-only findings; contract-bearing plans (one or more `Wired-into:` lines) are
  fully blocking. `inert` waivers resolve against on-disk paths (no network) or `gh issue
  view` for issue refs (open = waived, closed or `gh` error = fail-closed gap). See
  `src/conductor/README.md` → "Wiring reachability gate" for the full breakdown.
- **Manual-test FAIL routing + whitewash guard** (#367): `manual_test` is gating (locked —
  overrides and config disables are rejected) so a failing manual test can never be silently
  skipped. In daemon runs a manual_test that keeps FAILing kicks back to `build` with the
  FAIL rows as evidence (bounded, then HALT). The gate records the HEAD sha when it sees
  FAIL rows and refuses a FAIL→PASS rewrite with no new commits — a claimed fix must exist
  as commits. Results are append-only per attempt (`## Attempt N` sections; the latest
  section is the verdict). See `src/conductor/README.md` → "Daemon manual-test routing".
- **Parallel SHIP validation phase** (#469, auto mode only): when an auto-mode run
  (`inline`/`daemon`) reaches the SHIP validators, `manual_test`, `prd_audit`, and
  `architecture_review_as_built` fan out as a **concurrent validation group** instead of the
  serial walk — each branch on its own fresh session, bounded by the `validation_concurrency`
  config key (default **2**; zero/negative/non-numeric values fall back to 2; always capped at
  the number of actually-dispatchable members, so a width-1 group degrades to exact serial
  semantics). Branches never write state — a **single-writer join** recomputes every member's
  objective gate verdict from on-disk evidence after all branches settle, then writes
  `conduct-state.json` + `.pipeline/gates/*` once. Join classification preserves the serial
  guarantees: all-green advances; an MT-only FAIL takes the same deterministic
  `manual_test → build` kickback (#367); mixed gaps dispatch **one** `/remediate` over the
  union of failing members' evidence (shared `MAX_KICKBACKS_PER_GATE` budget, D2 no-op-cycle
  HALT parity); a branch with no verdict HALTs loudly. SIGINT mid-group persists each settled
  member's `done`, and a resumed run re-dispatches only unfinished members. Interactive runs
  are untouched — members execute via the pre-existing serial walk with their normal
  checkpoints. See `src/conductor/README.md` → "Parallel validation phase".
- **Rebase-on-latest before finish**: an engine-native `rebase` gate (no Claude dispatch)
  rebases the worktree branch onto the **discovered** origin default branch (fetched; falls
  back to the local base — no hardcoded `main`) before the PR is opened, so it's never built
  on a stale base. Its verdict is *branch already current with base*, so a no-op goes straight
  to finish. **Gate-first mechanical re-verify (evidence-intact optimization):** when a clean
  rebase changes **code/test paths**, the `build` gate's objective completion predicate (git
  evidence trailers, fresh re-derivation) is pre-verified against the rebased tree **before**
  kicking back. If pre-verify passes, dispatch is skipped (~1–2 min mechanical confirmation
  vs. ~45–60 min agent) and the gate is satisfied; if pre-verify fails or throws, `build` is
  kicked back normally (fail-closed). `build_review` and `manual_test` remain unconditionally
  invalidated. See `.docs/decisions/adr-2026-07-08-post-rebase-gate-first-mechanical-reverify.md`.
  A **CHANGELOG-only** `[Unreleased]` conflict is auto-resolved (both features' entries kept,
  each once); any other / mixed conflict triggers the **gated resolution loop** — the daemon
  dispatches the `/rebase` skill up to `rebase_resolution_attempts` times (config key, default
  3; set to 0 to disable) before HALTing. A resolution is accepted only when the branch is
  genuinely current with the base (FR-8) and no feature commits were dropped (FR-9); a
  code-changing resolution kicks back to `build`/`manual_test` as normal. If the loop is
  exhausted, the engine writes `.pipeline/HALT`, leaves the rebase **paused**, and opens no PR.
  The gated resolution loop is daemon-only; the `/rebase` skill is also manually invokable by
  an operator. Resume: resolve → `git rebase --continue` → `rm .pipeline/HALT` → re-queue.
- **Evidence citation translation across rebases** (#535): whenever either engine-owned rebase
  (rebase-on-latest above, or the daemon re-kick's play-forward rebase) actually rewrites
  commits, the engine automatically translates every sha-anchored evidence citation so rebases
  no longer orphan them — no new flag or config. It builds a `git patch-id --stable`
  old-sha→new-sha map, persists it to `.pipeline/rebase-rewrites.json`, rewrites
  `task-evidence.json`/`task-status.json`/`attribution-memo.json` sha references and the memo
  key in place, and resolves satisfied-by trailer citations through the map at read time
  (trailer text itself is never rewritten). Pre-rebase commits that can't be matched (dropped,
  or conflict-modified so their diff changed) are written to `.pipeline/rebase-residue.json`
  with a `rebase_citation_residue` event — a loud signal to re-verify, never a silent dangle.
  A sha that was never genuinely part of the rebase's pre-image is never laundered through the
  map; it still fails the existing ancestry check. See
  `.docs/decisions/adr-2026-07-12-rebase-evidence-stamp-translation.md`.
- **Daemon mode** (`conduct-ts daemon`): drains a backlog of features that already have
  stories **and** plans, running each in its own worktree (parallel via `--concurrency N`,
  bounded by `--max-items`), and opening a PR on finish. Per-feature failures are isolated;
  the pool keeps going.
- **Content-aware shipped-work dedup** (`.docs/shipped/<stem>.md`, #204, #205): the daemon's
  backlog discovery and its main-advance re-kick sweep both dedup against a **committed**
  record — `slug`, `spec_hash`, `pr`, `shipped` frontmatter committed **on the implementation
  PR branch** by the finish flow (`conduct-ts shipped-record --slug <stem> --pr <url|local>`,
  run by `/finish` before the branch's final push), so the human merge lands the code and the
  shipped-fact atomically — not just the local `.daemon/processed/` ledger. That ledger is
  now a **cache**, repaired opportunistically from shipped records; it is no longer required
  for correctness. A fresh clone or a wiped `.daemon/` directory therefore never re-dispatches
  or re-kicks a spec whose implementation already merged, and a renamed-but-unchanged spec is
  still caught by content-hash match. See
  [`src/conductor/README.md`](src/conductor/README.md) for the full dedup contract.
- **Engineer memory store** (daemon only): on each feature completion the daemon emits a
  structured learning signal + a narrative to a cross-project store at
  `~/.ai-conductor/engineer/` (override with `$AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR`). `signals.jsonl` holds
  one append-only JSON line per feature-run (outcome, kickbacks, halts, retry hotspots,
  token spend, per-step durations); `narratives/<project>/<feature>-<runId>.md` holds the
  full retro (`done`) or a short halt note (`halted`). To keep daemon-built repos clean, the
  in-loop `retro` step is **skipped under the daemon** and its narrative is redirected to the
  store; manual `/conduct` runs still write `.docs/retros/` unchanged. Emission is
  best-effort and append-safe — a store failure never breaks a ship.
- **Custom config steps run**: the conductor drives the resolved registry
  (`buildStepRegistry`), so custom steps from `.ai-conductor/config.yml` are dispatched and
  participate in the loop.
- **Project registry + creation** (`conduct register` / `conduct create`): a single-writer
  registry module owns `~/.ai-conductor/registry.json` (override with `$AI_CONDUCTOR_REGISTRY`)
  with atomic temp+rename writes, realpath-canonicalized dedup, credential redaction of remote
  URLs, and status provenance (a `created` project is never downgraded to `registered`).
  `conduct register [path]` records an existing git repo (name=basename, absolute path, redacted
  origin remote); `conduct create <name> [--remote <url>]` scaffolds a fresh project (git init +
  skeleton CLAUDE.md referencing HARNESS.md + `.gitignore` ignoring `.pipeline/`, `.daemon/`,
  `.worktrees/`; `--remote` is add-only, no push) and refuses to clobber a non-empty
  target.
  Both are **non-interactive** (run to completion and exit). `/bootstrap` auto-registers the
  project via `conduct register .` after onboarding (idempotent).
- **Pinned Node**: `conduct-ts` reads `src/conductor/.tool-versions` and exports
  `ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION` so the bundle runs on its required Node even when your shell's
  default is older.

See [`src/conductor/README.md`](src/conductor/README.md) for the gate-loop and daemon
internals (verdicts, selector, kickback, worker pool, task-status, auto-park, remediation).

**Task Status (engine-owned):** The engine is the single authority for
`.pipeline/task-status.json`. `Task: <id>` commit trailers are telemetry only — they update
progress/resolved-count reporting (#757) but no longer derive or gate task completion.
Build-step (and therefore task) completion is decided by `build_review`'s completeness
rubric: an LLM-judged, fail-closed, plan-vs-diff check. See `src/conductor/README.md` →
"Task Status (engine-owned)".

**Auto-park (#773 demotion):** the durable no-evidence-attempt counter park path has been
deleted — commit-stamping telemetry no longer drives auto-park. Auto-park now fires only
for an explicit, caller-supplied reason (e.g. an empty/missing plan at seed time); wall-clock
and attempt bounds elsewhere in the daemon still provide a survivable halt for stuck builds.
Unpark (`conduct daemon unpark <slug>`) clears the park marker and resumes. See
`src/conductor/README.md` → "Auto-park".

**Remediation (agentic gap routing):** When a SHIP gate blocks the daemon, the `/remediate`
planner analyzes the gap and routes back to the appropriate step or halts for human triage.
Three entry points (prd_audit, finish verification, architecture_review_as_built) and
deterministic task-id assignment keep task ledgers coherent across DECIDE rework. See
`src/conductor/README.md` → "Remediation (agentic gap routing)".

project and how to add tech-context for new stacks.

## Key Design Principles

1. **One skill, one responsibility** — Skills have singular focus
2. **Artifacts are the interface** — Skills communicate via files in `.docs/`, not internal orchestration
3. **Negative paths are mandatory** — Every story must have concrete failure scenarios
4. **Evaluator sees fresh context** — No shared state with the generator prevents confirmation bias
5. **Dry business logic, not dry code** — Extract shared behavior, not shared shape
6. **Anything approved twice should be automated** — Pre-approve routine operations
7. **Refactoring happens at batch boundaries** — GREEN phase stays minimal
8. **Every file gets a spec** — Unit specs + request specs, both required
9. **Memory persists across sessions** — Decisions, patterns, gotchas don't get re-discovered
10. **Self-improving** — Retro findings feed back into harness improvements
