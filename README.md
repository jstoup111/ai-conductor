# James Stoup Agents

A custom development harness for Claude Code. Pure Markdown skills and agent personas that enforce
a disciplined SDLC: design docs, user stories with mandatory negative paths, conflict detection,
TDD with domain review, evaluator-gated code review, and dual retrospectives.

No custom runtime. Claude Code is the execution engine.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/.docs/claude-code) v2.0+
- Git
- A project to work on (Rails+PostgreSQL has full tech-context support; other stacks work with generic skills)
- Optional: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — enables the opt-in [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena) semantic-code MCP integration (see Install)

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jstoup111/ai-conductor.git
cd ai-conductor
./bin/install
```

This symlinks all 20 skills into `~/.claude/skills/` and installs the conductor CLI(s) to
`~/.local/bin/`. `./bin/install` also builds the TypeScript conductor bundle for you —
it runs `npm install && npm run build` in `src/conductor/` (in both first-run and
`--update` mode) and symlinks `conduct-ts` once the bundle exists. The build needs
Node >= 20.5 (the repo pins 20.19.2 via `.tool-versions`); if Node is too old or `npm`
is missing, the build is skipped with a warning and `conduct` still installs. See
[Choosing a Conductor](#choosing-a-conductor) below — both binaries coexist, `conduct`
is the default, `conduct-ts` is opt-in.

**Optional: Serena semantic code toolkit.** When [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is
present, `./bin/install` offers an opt-in install of [Serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena)
(an LSP-backed semantic code-retrieval/editing toolkit). Once installed, `/bootstrap`
auto-registers it as a user-scope MCP server so it's available across your projects. Decline
the prompt (or install later with `uv tool install -p 3.13 serena-agent`) to skip it.

**Mermaid renderer.** `./bin/install` also offers a renderer for the architecture diagrams
and ADRs the harness generates, so you review them as visuals (not raw Mermaid) at the
approval gates. Pick a preset — `html` (default: a self-contained mermaid.js page opened in
your default browser; no native dependencies, works anywhere), `mmdc-png`/`mmdc-svg` (static
images via [`@mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli)), or `none`.
The choice is stored as `mermaid_renderer` in `~/.ai-conductor/config.yml` and reused on every
run; under `conduct-ts` diagrams render automatically when an artifact is presented for
approval, or run `conduct render-diagrams <file.md>...` on demand. The opener is detected per
platform (macOS `open`, Linux `xdg-open`, WSL `wslview`/`explorer.exe`). With no renderer
configured, diagrams fall back to raw Markdown — never a blocker.

The `mmdc-*` presets need Chromium. On WSL, in containers, or when running as root — where
Chromium's setuid sandbox can't initialize — the renderer automatically launches with
`--no-sandbox` (and an explicit Chrome `executablePath` when a system Chrome is found). To take
full control of how Chromium launches, drop a Puppeteer config at `~/.ai-conductor/puppeteer.json`
(e.g. `{ "executablePath": "/usr/bin/google-chrome", "args": ["--no-sandbox"] }`); when present it
overrides the auto-detection.

Verify:

```bash
./bin/install --check
```

Update (after pulling new changes):

```bash
git pull
./bin/install
```

Uninstall:

```bash
./bin/install --uninstall
```

**Worktree-root guard.** Global-mutating installs (default and `--update` modes) refuse to run
when the installer's own checkout physically resolves under a `.worktrees/` directory — a build
worktree is deleted at ship time, so installing from one would leave every global bin, skill
symlink, and `settings.json` hook path dangling (issue #363). The guard resolves the physical
path (`pwd -P`), so a symlinked path can't hide it. `--check`, `--help`, and `--uninstall` are
unaffected. To deliberately install from a worktree anyway, pass `--allow-worktree-root`
(combinable with any mode, inert on a normal checkout):

```bash
./bin/install --update --allow-worktree-root
```

## Quick Start

### Interactive (recommended for first use)

```bash
cd your-project/
claude
```

Then in the Claude Code session:

```
/conduct
```

The conductor checks artifact state, tells you what to run next, and blocks when gates aren't met.
It walks you through all 18 steps:

```
/bootstrap → /explore (track) → /prd (product track) → /architecture-diagram
→ /architecture-review → /stories → /conflict-check → /plan
→ /writing-system-tests → /pipeline → /manual-test
→ /prd-audit (product track) → /architecture-review --as-built → /retro → /finish
```

### Automated

```bash
cd your-project/

# The inline pipeline runs under the `inline` subcommand (foreground; the
# counterpart to the background `daemon`).

# Fully automated — walk away and come back
conduct inline --auto "URL shortener with click tracking"

# Default — auto with interactive recovery on failure
conduct inline "Add user authentication"

# Manual oversight — REPL mode for conversational steps (explore, prd, stories, plan, architecture_review, manual_test)
conduct inline --interactive "Payment processing"
```

```bash
conduct --status          # Check progress (shows all 16 steps)
conduct --resume          # Pick up where you left off
conduct --step stories    # Run one step only
conduct --from plan       # Start from a specific step
conduct --reset           # Clear session state and start fresh
```

Daemon mode (`conduct-ts` only) — drive many pre-specced features unattended, each in its
own worktree, opening a PR on finish:

```bash
# Drain the backlog once: every eligible feature, then exit
conduct-ts daemon

# Cap at 10 features this pass
conduct-ts daemon --max-items 10

# Continuous: keep polling for new features, bounded by ceilings
conduct-ts daemon --continuous --max-runtime 3600 --max-cost 2000000
```

Daemon flags: `--continuous` (idle-poll instead of draining once),
`--max-items <n>`, `--max-cost <tokens>`, `--max-runtime <seconds>`,
`--idle-poll <seconds>`, `--max-idle-polls <n>`. Ceilings stop *starting* new
features; in-flight work always drains. The daemon runs **serially** (one feature
at a time) so the live session shows exactly the feature building — `--concurrency`
above 1 is clamped to 1 with a logged note (real concurrency is out of scope; see
`.docs/plans/2026-06-29-daemon-tmux-supervisor.md`).

### Priority scheduling for issue-labeled backlog items

When a GitHub issue is labeled with priority metadata, the daemon orders eligible
features by priority band **after** passing the eligibility gate. This enables
human-driven build prioritization without changing the gate logic.

**Priority bands (highest to lowest):**
- `priority: high` — highest priority (no-issue status escalated)
- `priority: medium` — standard priority
- `priority: low` — lower priority
- Unlabeled (no priority label) — fallback chronological order

**Label vocabulary:**
The daemon reads GitHub issue labels via the REST API on each daemon scan.
Label names are exact matches: `priority: high`, `priority: medium`, `priority: low`.
If an issue has multiple priority labels, the highest-priority one wins.
Mixed or malformed labels are ignored (safe-fail).

**Refresh behavior:**
Labels are fetched fresh on each daemon scan (no caching across runs).
Within a single scan, results are cached (one network fetch per issue).
On reader failure (GitHub API outage, auth error), the daemon gracefully
degrades to chronological ordering and logs a single warning per outage.
When GitHub recovers and the next scan succeeds, the warning resets.

**Dashboard visibility:**
In the startup inherited-state dashboard, ELIGIBLE items now show a `[band]`
suffix indicating their priority band (e.g., `feature-name [high]`).
When in fallback mode (reader failure), a `[fallback]` marker appears on
all ELIGIBLE items, signaling that ordering is chronological.

**Interaction with other gates:**
Priority ordering is applied **post-gate**, after eligibility checks.
It never overrides the eligibility gate, park markers, deduplication,
owner gating, or dependency resolution — those gates remain unchanged.
A feature ineligible for any reason stays out of ELIGIBLE regardless
of its priority band.

The daemon consumes existing specs — it never authors them — and only picks up
**eligible** features: a feature is eligible when its stories are approved
(`Status: Accepted`, not DRAFT) and its plan declares a task dependency tree
(`## Task Dependency Graph` or per-task `**Dependencies:**` lines), and it hasn't
already shipped. Ineligible features are skipped with a logged reason. A feature
that can't converge is left in its worktree (`.pipeline/HALT`) for you; the pool
keeps going.

A blocking SHIP gate tries to self-heal before it halts: the conductor dispatches the
`/remediate` planner over the gate's gap artifact — a blocking prd-audit
(`.pipeline/prd-audit.md`), a failed finish verification (`.pipeline/test-failures.md`), or a
BLOCKED as-built architecture review (`.pipeline/architecture-review-as-built.md`) — and routes
each fixable gap back to the right step with concrete tasks, reserving the HALT for gaps that
genuinely need a human decision (architectural clarity or product scope).

On any irrecoverable daemon HALT that stranded committed work — a build/gating-step failure, a
prd-audit gap needing human DECIDE, the kickback/stuck-gate caps, or an unexpected error (rebase
conflicts excluded) — when the branch has at least one commit, the daemon pushes it and opens a
**draft PR** labeled `needs-remediation` with a comment explaining the HALT reason — best-effort
and non-blocking. PRs from successfully-shipped features
are enrolled in a watch registry (`.daemon/mergeable-watch.jsonl`); a label sweep (on startup,
after each feature, and each idle poll tick) keeps the `mergeable` label truthfully in sync with
CI and conflict state, so you can filter the PR list by merge-readiness. Both labels are
daemon-only; interactive runs are unchanged.

Opt-in via `mergeable_autoresolve: { enabled: true, cooldownMinutes: 60, suiteCommand: "..." }`
in your project config, the daemon can go further and **auto-resolve** conflicts on watched PRs
that drift to `CONFLICTING` instead of just labeling them: deterministic Tier-1 resolvers
(CHANGELOG, `.docs`) run first, unresolved conflicts fall through to the same gated `/rebase`
dispatch used at finish time (capped by `rebase_resolution_attempts`), and an accepted
resolution must pass acceptance guards (rebase clean, branch current, no dropped commits) and,
if configured, a fail-closed `suiteCommand` before a lease-protected
`git push --force-with-lease`. Any failure at any stage escalates to `needs-remediation`
instead of retrying blindly. See `src/conductor/README.md` → "Auto-resolve conflicts on open
watched PRs" for the full pipeline.

On startup, before any dispatch, the daemon prints a grouped **inherited-state
dashboard** (HALTED / IN-PROGRESS / **WAITING** / ELIGIBLE / PROCESSED) to both your
terminal and `daemon.log`. Each row shows the bits you triage on — complexity tier, the step a
feature reached, and the PR link once one is open (shipped features list their PR too).
**WAITING** lists build-ready specs held back by an unresolved GitHub issue dependency (a
`Source-Ref:` marker linked via GitHub's issue-dependencies API): the gate resolves each spec's
blocker chain and holds it out of ELIGIBLE until every blocker closes, distinguishing "blocked
by another open issue," "blocked by a dependency cycle," and "indeterminate" (a `gh` API error
or unparseable marker — fails closed, never dispatched). The engineer's intake claim similarly
skips blocked ideas and claims the oldest **unblocked** one, reporting a distinct "all-blocked"
outcome (never confused with an empty queue) when every pending idea is stuck. A one-time
`conduct-ts engineer migrate-issue-deps [--confirm]` command migrates repos whose issues
describe dependencies as prose into real GitHub issue-dependency links so the gate can see them.
See [`src/conductor/README.md`](src/conductor/README.md#dependency-ordered-intake-and-dispatch)
for details.
It also tracks the base-branch tip SHA (`.daemon/last-base-sha`): when
the base branch **actually advances** — live, or while the daemon was down — it
**re-kicks every halted feature** (aborting any paused rebase, preserving the reason
to `.pipeline/HALT.cleared`, clearing `.pipeline/HALT`) so parked work retries
automatically on the event most likely to unblock it, resuming **rebase-first** so the
advanced base is integrated before the failed gate re-checks. A plain restart with no
advance leaves every marker intact. See
[`src/conductor/README.md`](src/conductor/README.md#halt-reconciliation-startup-dashboard--main-advance-re-kick-adr-013).

The daemon is hosted as a **foreground process inside a per-repo tmux session**
(`cc-daemon-<slug>`), so you can attach to a *running* daemon on demand — in full color
— and restart or debug it without hunting for a pid. Its output is still teed to an
append-only **`.daemon/daemon.log`** (size-capped, rotated once) so the full narrative
survives. Each persisted line is prefixed with an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp so activity
read back via `daemon logs` can be correlated in time (the live console stays
uncluttered). Management requires `tmux` on the host; the daemon still builds with no
tmux present (management is purely additive).

```bash
conduct-ts daemon start      # start the daemon in a tmux session (idempotent — no duplicate)
conduct-ts daemon connect    # attach READ-ONLY to watch live, in color (Ctrl-b d to detach)
conduct-ts daemon debug      # attach read/write — Ctrl-c to pause the loop and inspect
conduct-ts daemon restart    # fresh inner process, same session
conduct-ts daemon stop       # stop the daemon, release the lock
```

Two read-only observability commands surface state without attaching:

```bash
# Liveness of every registered repo's daemon (running / stale / stopped, session up/down) + last activity
conduct-ts daemon status

# View or tail a repo's daemon log (default: current dir)
conduct-ts daemon logs
conduct-ts daemon logs --follow            # tail -f
conduct-ts daemon logs --repo /path/to/repo
conduct-ts daemon logs --all               # every registered repo
```

The management/observability verbs (`start`/`stop`/`restart`/`connect`/`debug`/`status`/
`logs`) are dispatched before the bare `conduct-ts daemon` run, so they're never mistaken
for a launch — and `conduct daemon <verb>` (the bash wrapper) now forwards to `conduct-ts`
instead of starting a feature build named after the verb.

**Operator park.** Prevent a worktree from being re-kicked or re-dispatched without stopping the
daemon:

```bash
conduct daemon park <slug>    # Parks the worktree; will not re-kick or dispatch until unparked
conduct daemon unpark <slug>  # Resumes normal re-kick and dispatch
```

The park state is stored in `.daemon/parked/<slug>`, validated against a known plan
(`.docs/plans/<slug>.md`) or worktree (`.worktrees/<slug>`) before writing. **Operator-parked is
not the same as HALTed:** a HALT (`.pipeline/HALT`) is written by the pipeline itself and cleared
automatically by re-kick; an operator-park is placed by a human and survives both — clearing a
HALT does not unpark a slug. Unlike a HALT, an operator-parked worktree preserves its REKICK
sentinel and resumes re-dispatch right where it left off once unparked. The status dashboard's
PARKED group takes absolute precedence over every other group (HALTED, ELIGIBLE, etc.) — a parked
slug always shows there and nowhere else. See
[`src/conductor/README.md`](src/conductor/README.md#operator-park--unpark) for details.

**Auto-restart on stale engine (self-host only).** In self-host mode, before starting each feature
(and at idle) the daemon rebuilds its engine from the fast-forwarded source (content-addressed —
a no-op when unchanged, an atomic `dist` flip otherwise) and checks whether the running engine has
gone stale. When it has and no tasks are in-flight, the daemon writes a `.daemon/RESTART_PENDING`
marker and exits cleanly, allowing an external respawn transport to relaunch with fresh code so the
next feature builds on it. Firing at the dispatch boundary — not only when the backlog drains —
ensures freshly-merged specs are never built on stale engine code (the rebuild is required because
build artifacts are untracked, so a merge alone never moves `dist`). It never interrupts an
in-flight build. Enable with `auto_restart_on_stale_engine: true` in your project config; ignored
in non-self-host environments and disabled in once-mode runs. Requires PR #215 respawn transport
for deployment.

On failure, conduct sends a desktop notification and drops into an interactive Claude session
to fix the issue. After you `/quit`, it rechecks artifacts and continues automatically.

Engineer mode (`conduct-ts` only) — an **agent-hosted, human-gated** loop that turns a free-form
idea into a routed, lesson-informed **spec PR**. It never builds and never merges (a merged spec PR
is the only idea→build handoff). As of Phase 9.3 there is no Node REPL and no spawned `claude` — the
host agent drives routing and the real DECIDE skills in-chat over deterministic TypeScript primitives:

```text
add a CSV export to the reporting tool
  → intake parses the idea into an Envelope (empty text is rejected, not dropped)
  → routes it across your registered projects (conduct register / create)
  → asks you to confirm:  confirm | decline | redirect <project> | create <path>
  → pulls relevant prior lessons from the engineer store into the spec
  → runs the FULL DECIDE phase for real, in canonical order: explore (track) → complexity →
    prd (product track) → architecture-diagram → architecture-review → stories →
    conflict-check → plan (tier-aware: Small skips conflict-check + architecture); the
    assessed tier is recorded at .docs/complexity/<slug>.md and consumed by the target's daemon
    (artifacts under .docs/ only; never a stub/DRAFT story or DRAFT ADR, never a spawned claude)
  → opens a spec PR, then ensure-running brings up the target's daemon
```

Every write is gated on your confirmation (decline = zero writes); authoring is **cross-repo
isolated** (repo A never touches sibling repo B; a stale target path fails fast) and multi-repo
**fan-out** authors each confirmed target independently. A no-remote target still commits the spec on
a branch (PR step is a non-fatal skip). Registry/store locations come from `$AI_CONDUCTOR_REGISTRY` /
`$AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR`. See `src/conductor/README.md` for the full flow and the pidfile-lock
daemon liveness model (`ensureRunning`, one-per-repo `O_EXCL` mutex, stale-pid reclaim).

Handles API rate limits by waiting for reset and auto-retrying.

### Claim-time delivery guard and recovery

The engineer's intake system is resilient to duplicate captures and write-back failures:

**Claim-time delivery guard (auto-healing duplicate dispatch).** When `engineer claim` is called, the intake system checks the ledger for entries that were claimed and delivered (prUrl present) but whose envelopes were re-captured as duplicates. If the PR is OPEN or MERGED, the entry is marked done and the duplicate envelope is dropped without being served to the session — reducing friction from duplicate captures. If the PR state is unknown (API unavailable, closed without merging), the envelope is held without mutation and released on the next claim if status resolves. Unknown-state envelopes are never re-served, preventing stalled-write issues from blocking the queue.

**`engineer resolve` recovery subcommand.** Recovers from write-back failures (e.g., local-commit completed but the spec PR was never delivered, or a network timeout during handoff) by marking a stranded intake entry as delivered. 

```bash
conduct-ts engineer resolve <sourceRef> --pr-url <url> [--branch <branch>]
```

Example:

```bash
# Mark issue o/a#123 as delivered with PR proof
conduct-ts engineer resolve o/a#123 --pr-url https://github.com/o/a/pull/456

# Optionally override the branch name (default: preserved from ledger)
conduct-ts engineer resolve o/a#123 --pr-url https://github.com/o/a/pull/456 --branch spec/main-fix
```

The command is **idempotent** — running it multiple times on the same entry with the same prUrl is safe and produces no additional mutations. An unknown sourceRef returns `found:false` and never creates a ledger entry.

**Integration: resolve + claim compose.** After resolve marks an entry delivered, a subsequent `engineer claim` with a duplicate envelope for that entry invokes the delivery guard, which heals and drops it — completing the recovery cycle end-to-end.

See `src/conductor/README.md` for the full implementation details.

## Choosing a Conductor

Two conductor binaries ship together. Both drive the same 16-step SDLC pipeline and read
the same `.pipeline/` state, so you can switch between them per-invocation. `conduct`
remains the default; `conduct-ts` is the in-progress rewrite — stable enough to use
day-to-day, but the surface is still changing.

|                              | `conduct` (bash, stable)                      | `conduct-ts` (TypeScript, opt-in)                                |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Status**                   | Reference implementation                      | Active rewrite — feature parity ongoing                          |
| **Install**                  | Always symlinked by `bin/install`             | Built + symlinked by `bin/install` when Node >= 20.5 is active   |
| **Build step**               | None                                          | `bin/install` runs `npm install && npm run build` in src/conductor/ |
| **CLI flags**                | Full surface (`--auto`, `--interactive`, …)   | Same flags **except `--interactive`** is not yet wired           |
| **Dashboard**                | Terminal status log                           | Event-driven renderer with live-region updates and tail pane     |
| **Completion gates**         | Artifact grep                                 | Typed events + structured gate-runner                            |
| **Auto-heal**                | None                                          | Reconciles stale `task-status.json` against git log before retry |
| **Pluggable UI**             | No                                            | Yes — UI is a subscriber behind the engine                       |
| **Test coverage**            | `test/test_conduct_worktree.sh`               | 673 vitest tests across engine/execution/UI/integration          |
| **Pinned Node**              | N/A                                           | Reads `src/conductor/.tool-versions` via asdf                    |

**Default:** use `conduct`. Everything in this README's examples works.

**Try `conduct-ts`** when you want the richer dashboard or auto-heal, or if you're helping
test the rewrite. Drop-in replace the binary name in any command; if a flag isn't
supported yet, commander will tell you.

### Command syntax and unknown-command guard

Both conductors validate command-line arguments strictly. Unknown options and bare single-word
commands are now rejected loudly with helpful error messages instead of silently launching the
pipeline. This prevents accidental typos and makes the CLI more discoverable:

- **Feature descriptions must be quoted multi-word strings:** `conduct "add user login"` (correct) 
  vs `conduct auth` (rejected — bare word).
- **Unknown options fail early:** `conduct --frobnicate` now prints "Unknown option: --frobnicate" 
  and suggests `--help` instead of silently treating it as a feature description.
- **Conduct-TS forwarded verbs are documented:** Verbs like `daemon`, `render-diagrams`, 
  `engineer`, etc. are forwarded to conduct-ts if it's available on PATH. Run `conduct --help` 
  to see the full list.

For details, see [Unknown-Command Guard](https://github.com/anthropics/ai-conductor#unknown-command-guard).

Both binaries read `~/.ai-conductor/config.yml` (user-level) and the project's
`.ai-conductor/config.yml` if present. Legacy `~/.claude/ai-conductor.config.json` is
read as a fallback for installs that predate the YAML migration.

See `src/conductor/README.md` for the three-layer architecture (Engine / Execution / UI)
behind `conduct-ts`.

## Configuration

The harness reads two config files, merged in order (project overrides user):

| File | Scope | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `~/.ai-conductor/config.yml` | User-level | Personal defaults, update channel, markdown viewer, mermaid renderer |
| `.ai-conductor/config.yml` | Project-level | Per-project model/effort tuning, custom steps, plugin selection |

Both files are optional. The conductor works with zero config.

### Model fallback ladder (`conduct-ts` only)

Skills and daemon steps are pinned to a preferred model (e.g. Fable for `rebase`,
`remediate`, `debugging` — see [Model Selection](HARNESS.md#model-selection)). If that
model is ever detected unavailable, the daemon no longer fails the step — it walks the
`model_fallback_ladder` and retries with the next model down until one succeeds.

- **Config key:** `model_fallback_ladder` — an optional top-level array of model names
  in `.ai-conductor/config.yml`.
- **Default:** `["fable", "opus", "sonnet"]`.
- **Disabling:** set `model_fallback_ladder: []` to turn off fallback (an unavailable
  model then fails the step as before).
- **Matching:** exact-string match against the configured/pinned model name.
- **Restart semantics:** "known unavailable" models are cached per-process only.
  Restarting the daemon clears the cache, so the next run retries from the top of the
  ladder in case the model has recovered.
- **Override:** the `--model` CLI flag and `steps.<step>.model` config still take
  precedence as an explicit override — but the override is itself checked for
  availability, and falls back down the ladder if it's unavailable too.
- **Logging:** every downgrade is written to the conductor logs as
  `Downgraded from <configured> to <fallback>: <reason>` — check there if a step ran on
  an unexpected model.

### Operator identity & owner gate (multi-operator, `conduct-ts` only)

When two or more operators run daemons on **separate machines against the same repo**, each
daemon must build **only its own** specs — no duplication, no silent stalls. That partition
is keyed on an **operator identity** (`spec_owner`).

**Identity is machine-scoped — set it in your USER config, never the project config.**

```yaml
# ~/.ai-conductor/config.yml   (per machine — NOT committed)
spec_owner: your-github-login
```

- **Resolution chain:** user-config `spec_owner` → `gh` login → unresolved. An explicit
  `spec_owner` always wins over the ambient `gh` login (deterministic).
- **Anti-leak (hard guard):** `spec_owner` committed into a **project** `.ai-conductor/config.yml`
  is a config-load **rejection** — it would leak your identity to everyone who pulls the repo.
  The error names the file and the fix (move it to `~/.ai-conductor/config.yml`).
- **Fail-closed:** a daemon that can resolve **no** identity (no user-config `spec_owner`
  and no `gh` login) builds **nothing** and logs a loud, once-per-pass notice — it never
  falls back to building every operator's work.
- **Un-owned specs are surfaced, never silently skipped:** a merged spec with no `Owner:`
  marker is skipped with a distinct, deduped line telling you to add an `Owner:` marker on
  the default branch (or grandfather it via `owner_gate_cutover`).

**GATED dashboard section:** every daemon status view (`conduct-ts daemon-status`, the
startup dashboard, `.daemon/gated.json`) carries a `GATED (n)` group alongside
PARKED/HALTED/PROCESSED/IN-PROGRESS/WAITING/ELIGIBLE. It always renders explicitly — even
`GATED (0)` — so an empty backlog is never mistaken for "nothing to do" when the real cause
is an unresolved owner gate. Each `kind: 'spec'` row names the slug, the skip reason
(`other-owner` / `unowned-post-cutover` / `unowned-indeterminate`), the other operator when
known, and a remedy hint; each `kind: 'repo'` row is a section-level warning (e.g. "building
NOTHING — identity unresolved" or "un-owned specs skipped — no owner_gate_cutover
configured") for conditions with no single owning slug.

**Gate write-back (owner-gated PR/issue announcement):** on every discovery pass, the daemon
also announces each owner-gated spec where a GitHub artifact exists to announce on:
  - if the spec already has an implementation PR open (e.g. a prior build attempt halted
    before ownership changed underneath it), the PR gets an `owner-gated` label and a single
    upserted marker comment naming the reason/remedy/other-owner — edited in place on later
    passes rather than duplicated, and updated when the reason transitions (e.g.
    `unowned-indeterminate` → `other-owner`);
  - if the spec originated from GitHub issue intake (carries a `Source-Ref: owner/repo#N`
    marker), the same label + marker comment are applied to the originating **issue** too, so
    the reporter sees why their request stalled without needing daemon/dashboard access.

Both write-backs are best-effort and non-throwing — a `gh` failure never blocks or aborts the
discovery pass that produced the gated list.

**Daemon Profile & Version Gate (Self-Host)**

As of 2026-07-02T11:00:00Z, this harness repo is daemon-registered for build-to-PR automation
(see adr-2026-07-03-harness-daemon-profile). The version_approval_gate is enabled and enforces
semantic version classification:

| Change Type | Signal | Action |
|---|---|---|
| PATCH-safe only | PATCH | Auto-pass, audit recorded in .pipeline/version-signal.json |
| New skills/hooks/gates | MINOR | HALT — requires manual .pipeline/version-approval marker |
| Breaking surfaces | MAJOR | HALT — requires manual .pipeline/version-approval marker |
| Unknown/ambiguous paths | undeterminable | HALT — requires investigation and manual marker |

**Audit Record**: On PATCH auto-pass, the gate writes `.pipeline/version-signal.json` with
classification details for audit and debugging.

When opening a PR against main:
- If the daemon detects a PATCH-safe change, it auto-passes the version gate
- If MINOR/MAJOR/undeterminable, the PR HALTs; manually record the approved version in
  `.pipeline/version-approval` to proceed

### OpenTelemetry observability (`conduct-ts` only)

The TypeScript conductor can export run/step traces and metrics to any OTel-compatible
backend (Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, etc.) or to a local JSONL file. Add an `otel:`
block to your project config to opt in:

```yaml
# OTLP HTTP (default port 4318 — Jaeger, Grafana Tempo, Honeycomb, …):
otel:
  exporter: otlp
  endpoint: http://localhost:4318

# gRPC transport (port 4317):
otel:
  exporter: otlp
  endpoint: http://localhost:4317
  protocol: grpc

# File — writes OTLP-JSON newline-delimited to .pipeline/otel.jsonl:
otel:
  exporter: file
```

**Default-off.** Absent `otel:` block → zero overhead. Coexists with `events.jsonl` and
`--report`; event-emission sites are not modified.

**What you get:**
- One `conductor.run` trace per run, with one child span per step.
- `conductor.step.duration` histogram, `conductor.step.retries` counter, and
  `conductor.step.tokens` counter (only when token usage is present).
- Resource attributes: `conductor.run.id`, `conductor.feature`, `conductor.project`,
  `service.name=ai-conductor` on every span.
- Incomplete spans (interrupted run) are force-closed ERROR with `conductor.incomplete=true`.
- SIGINT/SIGTERM flush within the configured `exportTimeoutMillis` (default 5 s).

See `src/conductor/README.md → OpenTelemetry exporter` for the full implementation
reference.

### Sandbox auth-expiry park-and-poll

When the daemon builds a feature in a headless (sandbox/self-hosted) environment, the operator's
Claude API credentials may expire mid-build. The daemon detects auth failures and expired credentials
via two entry points:

1. **Pre-flight expiry check** — before provisioning a sandbox build, checks the operator's credentials
   file (`~/.claude/.credentials.json`) for an expired `claudeAiOauth.expiresAt` timestamp. Expired
   credentials immediately trigger a **park-and-poll** wait.
2. **Step-level auth failure** — if a step fails with "Not logged in" or "Invalid API key" output,
   the daemon treats it as an auth failure and enters the park-and-poll wait (see below).

**Park-and-poll behavior:**
When auth is blocked (expired or failed), instead of failing the feature immediately, the daemon
**parks** the feature and waits for the operator to refresh their credentials:
- Watches the operator's credentials file for an **mtime change** (indicating a refresh)
- When the file changes AND the credentials are no longer expired, **resumes** the feature
- Re-copies the refreshed credentials into the sandbox and retries the step with **budget intact**
  (parking consumes zero retries)
- Timeout (configurable, default **60 minutes**): if credentials are not refreshed within the window,
  HALTs with a reason naming the credentials path and observed expiry time

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# .ai-conductor/config.yml (project level)
auth_park_timeout_minutes: 60      # default: 60 minutes; 0 or negative = opt-out (HALT immediately)
```

**Opt-out:** Set `auth_park_timeout_minutes: 0` or a negative value to disable park-and-poll.
On auth failure or expiry, the feature HALTs immediately instead of waiting.

**HALT reason:** When the park window times out, the HALT reason includes:
- The credentials file path that was watched
- The observed `expiresAt` timestamp (or "unparseable" if unreadable)

**Remediation:** Standard HALT remediation applies (no new process):
1. Operator refreshes credentials (login via `claude login`)
2. Standard HALT recovery: clear `.pipeline/HALT`, observe `.pipeline/HALT.cleared` marker,
   and re-queue the feature via the base-SHA advance re-kick logic (see ADR-013) or manual dispatch.

See `src/conductor/README.md` → "Sandbox auth-expiry park-and-poll" for implementation details.

### Harness self-host guardrails (`conduct-ts` only)

The harness is the one repo the daemon can't build the way it builds every other repo — a self-build
edits the very skills/hooks it is executing, on a machine whose concurrent Claude sessions all read
the global `~/.claude/skills`. To make the `james-stoup-agents` harness repo safe to daemon-register,
a **self-host mode** (configured by the `harness_self_host` block above) activates a guardrail bundle
**only** for a harness self-build — every other repo's path is unchanged (the only added cost is one
detector boolean):

- **`SelfHostDetector`** — recognizes a self-build by comparing the build repo's realpath to the
  harness root (identity is by path, never repo name). `activation: force_on|force_off` overrides it;
  the detector is a swappable interface, the replacement point for a future platform identity.
- **`SkillRelinkPreflight`** — relinks harness skills (`bin/install --update`) before dispatch so a
  self-build that adds or renames a skill never HALTs on "no parseable result" from a stale symlink.
- **`SandboxBuildEnv`** — runs the self-build against a **throwaway `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`** whose
  `skills/` + `hooks/` link into the build worktree, so it exercises its *own edited harness* without
  ever mutating the global `~/.claude` the operator's live sessions read. It also **copies** the
  operator's `.credentials.json` (so the headless build authenticates) and a `settings.json` whose
  harness-checkout hook paths are **retargeted to the worktree** (so the build fires its *own* edited
  hooks). Copies — never symlinks — so no sandbox link resolves to a global-config target. Fails
  closed if a worktree link target is missing; torn down on pass, fail, or crash.
- **`VersionApprovalGate` + `ReleaseArtifactGate`** — HALT-based, fail-closed finish gates:
  VERSION-bump approval, `test/test_harness_integrity.sh`, a non-empty CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`, and a
  `## Migration` block for breaking changes. In the daemon's unattended `auto` mode there is no prompt,
  so any gate that can't self-satisfy writes `.pipeline/HALT` and the PR is not opened.

**The daemon never merges** (ADR-005/ADR-010): every self-build ends at a HALT for the operator to
re-install, `/verify`, and merge. Config is safe-by-default — an absent or partial `harness_self_host`
block auto-detects with all gates on.

**How it activates in the loop.** The daemon classifies self-host **once** at startup (against the
main repo root, honoring the `activation` override) and threads a single `selfHost` flag to each
build. For a self-build only: skills are relinked before the first `build`; the `build` step runs with
`process.env.CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` scoped to the sandbox **for the duration of that step and restored
afterward** (nothing bleeds into `finish`); and the VERSION + release gates run **before** the
`finish` step opens the PR — a failing gate writes `.pipeline/HALT` so the PR never opens. Every part
is gated behind that one flag, so any other repo's build path is byte-for-byte unchanged.

> **Status:** active for self-builds. The guardrail bundle (`src/conductor/src/engine/self-host/`) is
> wired into the daemon loop; the harness can be daemon-registered with self-host mode on. See
> `src/conductor/README.md → Harness self-host guardrails` for the module + wiring reference.

### Plugins (`conduct-ts` only)

The TypeScript conductor supports a plugin system for swapping the LLM provider or UI renderer
without modifying source code. Plugins are discovered from two directories at startup:

| Directory | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| `~/.ai-conductor/plugins/<name>/` | Global — available to all projects |
| `.ai-conductor/plugins/<name>/` | Project-local — overrides global for same kind+name |

**Writing a plugin manifest (`plugin.yml`):**

```yaml
kind: llm_provider             # llm_provider | ui_renderer | step | hook | visualizer
name: my-provider              # lowercase letters, digits, hyphens only — no path chars
entrypoint: ./index.js         # relative to the plugin directory
harness_version: ">=0.99.4"   # semver range — conductor rejects incompatible plugins
capabilities:                  # optional freeform metadata
  streaming: false
  recording: true
```

**Example: install a custom LLM provider**

```bash
# Create the plugin directory
mkdir -p ~/.ai-conductor/plugins/my-provider

# Write the manifest
cat > ~/.ai-conductor/plugins/my-provider/plugin.yml <<EOF
kind: llm_provider
name: my-provider
entrypoint: ./index.js
harness_version: ">=0.99.4"
EOF

# Write the entrypoint (must export invoke() and invokeInteractive())
cat > ~/.ai-conductor/plugins/my-provider/index.js <<EOF
export default {
  async invoke(options) {
    // options: { prompt, model, effort, sessionId, projectRoot }
    return { success: true, output: "...", exitCode: 0 };
  },
  async invokeInteractive(options) {
    // called for conversational (REPL) steps
  },
};
EOF

# Select it in your project config
echo "llm_provider: my-provider" >> .ai-conductor/config.yml
```

**Built-in plugins (always available, no install needed):**

| Kind | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `llm_provider` | `claude` | Default — invokes Claude CLI via `execa` |
| `ui_renderer` | `terminal` | Default — ink-based live dashboard |
| `memory_provider` | `local` | Default — shared canonical store at `~/.ai-conductor/memory/<key>/harness/` symlinked as `.memory/`; recall is agent-driven (no harness-side search) |

**Plugin load rules:**

- Manifest validation errors (invalid kind, bad name format) → plugin skipped with a warning; other plugins still load.
- Version incompatibility (`harness_version` range excludes current version) → startup aborted with `PluginVersionError`.
- Missing entrypoint file → startup aborted with `PluginLoadError` naming the missing path.
- Project-local plugin with the same `kind:name` as a global plugin → project-local wins; a debug log line records the shadowing.

## How It Works

### SDLC Flow

```
UNDERSTAND → DECIDE → BUILD → SHIP
```

| Phase | Skills | What Happens |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| UNDERSTAND | `/bootstrap`, `/memory`, `/assess` | Detect/scaffold project, load tech-context, recall prior decisions, codebase health assessment |
| DECIDE | `/explore` (track) → `/prd` (product) → `/architecture-diagram` → `/architecture-review` → `/stories` → `/conflict-check` → `/plan` | Explore + track → product-only PRD → architecture (ADRs) → stories → conflicts → tasks |
| BUILD | `/writing-system-tests` → `/pipeline` or `/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/debugging` | Acceptance specs → TDD → evaluator gates |
| SHIP | `/manual-test` → `/prd-audit` → `/architecture-review --as-built` → `/retro` → `/finish`, `/pr` | curl/browser validation → PRD compliance audit → as-built architecture sweep → dual retrospective → verification → pull request |

### Agent Personas

Skills define *what* to do. Agents define *who* does it with what context.

| Agent | Role | Key Trait |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Generator | Writes tests and code | Context-isolated: RED sees only tests, GREEN sees only source |
| Evaluator | Reviews with skepticism | Fresh context, no shared state with generator |
| Domain Reviewer | Checks domain integrity | Veto authority — can reject and send back |
| Planner | Expands requirements | Surfaces edge cases the user didn't consider |
| Worktree Manager | Git worktree lifecycle | Feature isolation via create/merge/cleanup/status |
| CTO Security | Auth & input validation | OWASP top 10, attack vector analysis |
| CTO Data Integrity | Transactions & race conditions | Event sourcing, data safety |
| CTO Dependencies | Package & license auditing | CVEs, outdated packages, license compliance |
| CTO Architecture | Coherence & coupling | Decisions vs implementation alignment |
| CTO Duplication | Code duplication detection | Boilerplate, copy-paste, blast radius |
| CTO Testing | Test strategy review | Coverage gaps, layer balance, assertion quality |
| CTO Infrastructure | Infra config review | DB pooling, caching, background jobs, prod parity |
| CTO Observability | Logging & monitoring | Error handling, debugging context |
| CTO DevEx | Developer experience | Onboarding, CI/CD, local dev, documentation |
| CTO Orchestrator | Synthesizes 9 specialist reports | Cross-references and prioritizes findings |

### Enforcement Levels

| Level | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Advisory | Instructions only | Brainstorm: "ask one question at a time" |
| Gating | Evidence required | Stories: no story accepted without concrete negative paths |
| Structural | Subagent isolation | TDD: RED agent can't see source files |
| Mechanical | Git hooks (opt-in) | Pre-commit: block commits outside COMMIT phase |

### Tech-Context

Stack-specific knowledge in `tech-context/`. Currently supported:

| Stack | Context Files |
|-------|--------------|
| Rails + PostgreSQL | `tdd.md` (RSpec, factories), `stories.md` (N+1, migrations, enums), `review.md` (security, performance), `debugging.md` (tools, gotchas) |

Tech-context is additive — it supplements skills, never overrides them. Projects without matching
tech-context use generic skill behavior.

## TypeScript Conductor (`src/conductor/`)

The TypeScript rewrite behind `conduct-ts`. Three-layer architecture —
Engine / Execution / UI — with typed events, pluggable UI renderers, and
dedicated test coverage (950+ tests). See the feature comparison in
[Choosing a Conductor](#choosing-a-conductor); implementation notes below.

- **`bin/conduct-ts`** is a thin shell wrapper around `src/conductor/dist/index.js`.
- **Engine** owns state machine, gates, completion checks, auto-heal logic.
- **Execution** invokes Claude via `execa` with session + rate-limit handling.
- **UI** is a pluggable subscriber: the default terminal renderer is event-driven.
- **Auto-heal**: before a build-gate retry, the engine cross-checks
  `.pipeline/task-status.json` against git log and flips pending tasks to completed
  when there's unambiguous evidence of a prior-run commit. Audit trail under
  `.pipeline/audit-trail/autoheal-*.json`.
- **Bootstrap-mode skip**: when bootstrap detects a `new`-mode project (empty directory
  before scaffolding), the conductor skips `assess` rather than dispatching 9 specialists
  against a blank codebase.
- **Gate-driven loop**: the SHIP-phase tail (`build → manual_test → retro → rebase → finish`)
  is driven by a *selector* over machine-checkable **gate verdicts** rather than a fixed
  order. A downstream step can **kick back** to `plan`/`stories` (re-open an upstream gate);
  the loop converges to `.pipeline/DONE` or stops at `.pipeline/HALT`. Opt-in via
  `verifyArtifacts`; every step runs on a fresh LLM session (unconditional).
- **Manual-test FAIL routing + whitewash guard** (#367): `manual_test` is gating (locked —
  overrides and config disables are rejected) so a failing manual test can never be silently
  skipped. In daemon runs a manual_test that keeps FAILing kicks back to `build` with the
  FAIL rows as evidence (bounded, then HALT). The gate records the HEAD sha when it sees
  FAIL rows and refuses a FAIL→PASS rewrite with no new commits — a claimed fix must exist
  as commits. Results are append-only per attempt (`## Attempt N` sections; the latest
  section is the verdict). See `src/conductor/README.md` → "Daemon manual-test routing".
- **Rebase-on-latest before finish**: an engine-native `rebase` gate (no Claude dispatch)
  rebases the worktree branch onto the **discovered** origin default branch (fetched; falls
  back to the local base — no hardcoded `main`) before the PR is opened, so it's never built
  on a stale base. Its verdict is *branch already current with base*, so a no-op goes straight
  to finish. A clean rebase that changed **code/test paths** kicks back to `build` to
  re-verify; a **CHANGELOG-only** `[Unreleased]` conflict is auto-resolved (both features'
  entries kept, each once); any other / mixed conflict triggers the **gated resolution loop**
  — the daemon dispatches the `/rebase` skill up to `rebase_resolution_attempts` times
  (config key, default 3; set to 0 to disable) before HALTing. A resolution is accepted only
  when the branch is genuinely current with the base (FR-8) and no feature commits were
  dropped (FR-9); a code-changing resolution kicks back to `build`/`manual_test` as normal.
  If the loop is exhausted, the engine writes `.pipeline/HALT`, leaves the rebase **paused**,
  and opens no PR. The gated resolution loop is daemon-only; the `/rebase` skill is also
  manually invokable by an operator. Resume: resolve → `git rebase --continue` →
  `rm .pipeline/HALT` → re-queue.
- **Daemon mode** (`conduct-ts daemon`): drains a backlog of features that already have
  stories **and** plans, running each in its own worktree (parallel via `--concurrency N`,
  bounded by `--max-items`), and opening a PR on finish. Per-feature failures are isolated;
  the pool keeps going.
- **Content-aware shipped-work dedup** (`.docs/shipped/<stem>.md`, #204, #205): the daemon's
  backlog discovery and its main-advance re-kick sweep both dedup against a **committed**
  record — `slug`, `spec_hash`, `pr`, `shipped` frontmatter committed **on the implementation
  PR branch** by the finish flow (`conduct-ts shipped-record --slug <stem> --pr <url|local>`,
  run by `/finish` before the branch's final push), so the human merge lands the code and the
  shipped-fact atomically — not just the local `.daemon/processed/` ledger. That ledger is
  now a **cache**, repaired opportunistically from shipped records; it is no longer required
  for correctness. A fresh clone or a wiped `.daemon/` directory therefore never re-dispatches
  or re-kicks a spec whose implementation already merged, and a renamed-but-unchanged spec is
  still caught by content-hash match. See
  [`src/conductor/README.md`](src/conductor/README.md) for the full dedup contract.
- **Engineer memory store** (daemon only): on each feature completion the daemon emits a
  structured learning signal + a narrative to a cross-project store at
  `~/.ai-conductor/engineer/` (override with `$AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR`). `signals.jsonl` holds
  one append-only JSON line per feature-run (outcome, kickbacks, halts, retry hotspots,
  token spend, per-step durations); `narratives/<project>/<feature>-<runId>.md` holds the
  full retro (`done`) or a short halt note (`halted`). To keep daemon-built repos clean, the
  in-loop `retro` step is **skipped under the daemon** and its narrative is redirected to the
  store; manual `/conduct` runs still write `.docs/retros/` unchanged. Emission is
  best-effort and append-safe — a store failure never breaks a ship.
- **Custom config steps run**: the conductor drives the resolved registry
  (`buildStepRegistry`), so custom steps from `.ai-conductor/config.yml` are dispatched and
  participate in the loop.
- **Project registry + creation** (`conduct register` / `conduct create`): a single-writer
  registry module owns `~/.ai-conductor/registry.json` (override with `$AI_CONDUCTOR_REGISTRY`)
  with atomic temp+rename writes, realpath-canonicalized dedup, credential redaction of remote
  URLs, and status provenance (a `created` project is never downgraded to `registered`).
  `conduct register [path]` records an existing git repo (name=basename, absolute path, redacted
  origin remote); `conduct create <name> [--remote <url>]` scaffolds a fresh project (git init +
  skeleton CLAUDE.md referencing HARNESS.md + `.gitignore` ignoring `.pipeline/`, `.daemon/`,
  `.worktrees/`, `.serena/`; `--remote` is add-only, no push) and refuses to clobber a non-empty
  target.
  Both are **non-interactive** (run to completion and exit). `/bootstrap` auto-registers the
  project via `conduct register .` after onboarding (idempotent).
- **Pinned Node**: `conduct-ts` reads `src/conductor/.tool-versions` and exports
  `ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION` so the bundle runs on its required Node even when your shell's
  default is older.

See [`src/conductor/README.md`](src/conductor/README.md) for the gate-loop and daemon
internals (verdicts, selector, kickback, worker pool).

Bootstrap detects your stack (Node+TS, Rails+Rubocop, Python+ruff/mypy, Rust+clippy,
Go+vet) and writes the lint command into `.claude/settings.json` as a `PreToolUse(Bash)`
hook with `if: "Bash(gh pr create*)"`. Linting becomes fully deterministic machinery —
TDD, pipeline, and code-review skills never invoke the linter themselves. Non-zero
exit from the lint command blocks the PR; users edit the command in place.

## Adding Tech-Context for New Stacks

See `tech-context/FORMAT.md` for the contract. Each stack gets a directory with up to 4 files:

```
tech-context/<framework>-<database>/
├── tdd.md        # Test framework, factories, assertions, patterns
├── stories.md    # Stack-specific negative path categories
├── review.md     # Security checklist, performance checklist, antipatterns
└── debugging.md  # Tools, log locations, common gotchas
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **One skill, one responsibility** — Skills have singular focus
2. **Artifacts are the interface** — Skills communicate via files in `.docs/`, not internal orchestration
3. **Negative paths are mandatory** — Every story must have concrete failure scenarios
4. **Evaluator sees fresh context** — No shared state with the generator prevents confirmation bias
5. **Dry business logic, not dry code** — Extract shared behavior, not shared shape
6. **Anything approved twice should be automated** — Pre-approve routine operations
7. **Refactoring happens at batch boundaries** — GREEN phase stays minimal
8. **Every file gets a spec** — Unit specs + request specs, both required
9. **Memory persists across sessions** — Decisions, patterns, gotchas don't get re-discovered
10. **Self-improving** — Retro findings feed back into harness improvements
