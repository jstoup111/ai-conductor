# James Stoup Agents

A custom development harness for Claude Code. Pure Markdown skills and agent personas that enforce
a disciplined SDLC: design docs, user stories with mandatory negative paths, conflict detection,
TDD with domain review, evaluator-gated code review, and dual retrospectives.

No custom runtime. Claude Code is the execution engine.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/.docs/claude-code) v2.0+
- Git
- A project to work on (Rails+PostgreSQL has full tech-context support; other stacks work with generic skills)

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesstoup/james-stoup-agents.git
cd james-stoup-agents
./bin/install
```

This symlinks all 20 skills into `~/.claude/skills/` and puts the `conduct` script on your PATH
via `~/.local/bin/`.

Verify:

```bash
./bin/install --check
```

Update (after pulling new changes):

```bash
git pull
./bin/install
```

Uninstall:

```bash
./bin/install --uninstall
```

## Quick Start

### Interactive (recommended for first use)

```bash
cd your-project/
claude
```

Then in the Claude Code session:

```
/conduct
```

The conductor checks artifact state, tells you what to run next, and blocks when gates aren't met.
It walks you through all 14 steps:

```
/bootstrap → /brainstorm → /stories → /conflict-check → /plan → /architecture-diagram
→ /architecture-review → /writing-system-tests → /pipeline → /finish → /manual-test → /retro
```

### Automated

```bash
cd your-project/

# Fully automated — walk away and come back
conduct --auto "URL shortener with click tracking"

# Default — auto with interactive recovery on failure
conduct "Add user authentication"

# Manual oversight — interactive Claude for every step
conduct --interactive "Payment processing"
```

```bash
conduct --status          # Check progress (shows all 14 steps)
conduct --resume          # Pick up where you left off
conduct --step stories    # Run one step only
conduct --from plan       # Start from a specific step
conduct --reset           # Clear session state and start fresh
```

On failure, conduct sends a desktop notification and drops into an interactive Claude session
to fix the issue. After you `/quit`, it rechecks artifacts and continues automatically.

Handles API rate limits by waiting for reset and auto-retrying.

## How It Works

### SDLC Flow

```
UNDERSTAND → DECIDE → BUILD → SHIP
```

| Phase | Skills | What Happens |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| UNDERSTAND | `/bootstrap`, `/memory`, `/assess` | Detect/scaffold project, load tech-context, recall prior decisions, codebase health assessment |
| DECIDE | `/brainstorm` → `/stories` → `/conflict-check` → `/plan` → `/architecture-diagram` → `/architecture-review` | Design → stories → conflicts → tasks → diagrams → architecture gate |
| BUILD | `/writing-system-tests` → `/pipeline` or `/tdd`, `/code-review`, `/debugging` | Acceptance specs → TDD → evaluator gates |
| SHIP | `/finish` → `/manual-test` → `/retro`, `/pr` | Verification → curl/browser validation → dual retrospective → pull request |

### Skills (20 total)

| Skill | Enforcement | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|-------|---------|
| `/bootstrap` | Advisory | sonnet | Detect/scaffold project, .claudeignore, smoke test, MCP setup |
| `/memory` | Gating | haiku | Recall/persist decisions, patterns, gotchas across sessions |

| `/conduct` | Gating | haiku | SDLC orchestrator: 14-step flow with gate enforcement |

### Agent Personas

Skills define *what* to do. Agents define *who* does it with what context.

| Agent | Role | Key Trait |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Generator | Writes tests and code | Context-isolated: RED sees only tests, GREEN sees only source |
| Evaluator | Reviews with skepticism | Fresh context, no shared state with generator |
| Domain Reviewer | Checks domain integrity | Veto authority — can reject and send back |
| Planner | Expands requirements | Surfaces edge cases the user didn't consider |
| Worktree Manager | Git worktree lifecycle | Feature isolation via create/merge/cleanup/status |
| CTO Security | Auth & input validation | OWASP top 10, attack vector analysis |
| CTO Data Integrity | Transactions & race conditions | Event sourcing, data safety |
| CTO Dependencies | Package & license auditing | CVEs, outdated packages, license compliance |
| CTO Architecture | Coherence & coupling | Decisions vs implementation alignment |
| CTO Duplication | Code duplication detection | Boilerplate, copy-paste, blast radius |
| CTO Testing | Test strategy review | Coverage gaps, layer balance, assertion quality |
| CTO Infrastructure | Infra config review | DB pooling, caching, background jobs, prod parity |
| CTO Observability | Logging & monitoring | Error handling, debugging context |
| CTO DevEx | Developer experience | Onboarding, CI/CD, local dev, documentation |
| CTO Orchestrator | Synthesizes 9 specialist reports | Cross-references and prioritizes findings |

### Enforcement Levels

| Level | Mechanism | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Advisory | Instructions only | Brainstorm: "ask one question at a time" |
| Gating | Evidence required | Stories: no story accepted without concrete negative paths |
| Structural | Subagent isolation | TDD: RED agent can't see source files |
| Mechanical | Git hooks (opt-in) | Pre-commit: block commits outside COMMIT phase |

### Tech-Context

Stack-specific knowledge in `tech-context/`. Currently supported:

| Stack | Context Files |
|-------|--------------|
| Rails + PostgreSQL | `tdd.md` (RSpec, factories), `stories.md` (N+1, migrations, enums), `review.md` (security, performance), `debugging.md` (tools, gotchas) |

Tech-context is additive — it supplements skills, never overrides them. Projects without matching
tech-context use generic skill behavior.

## Adding Tech-Context for New Stacks

See `tech-context/FORMAT.md` for the contract. Each stack gets a directory with up to 4 files:

```
tech-context/<framework>-<database>/
├── tdd.md        # Test framework, factories, assertions, patterns
├── stories.md    # Stack-specific negative path categories
├── review.md     # Security checklist, performance checklist, antipatterns
└── debugging.md  # Tools, log locations, common gotchas
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **One skill, one responsibility** — Skills have singular focus
2. **Artifacts are the interface** — Skills communicate via files in `.docs/`, not internal orchestration
3. **Negative paths are mandatory** — Every story must have concrete failure scenarios
4. **Evaluator sees fresh context** — No shared state with the generator prevents confirmation bias
5. **Dry business logic, not dry code** — Extract shared behavior, not shared shape
6. **Anything approved twice should be automated** — Pre-approve routine operations
7. **Refactoring happens at batch boundaries** — GREEN phase stays minimal
8. **Every file gets a spec** — Unit specs + request specs, both required
9. **Memory persists across sessions** — Decisions, patterns, gotchas don't get re-discovered
10. **Self-improving** — Retro findings feed back into harness improvements
