# Changelog

All notable changes to this harness are documented here.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Release cadence: tags `vX.Y.Z` are cut automatically by CI on merge to `main`
(see `.github/workflows/release.yml`). Every PR must add an entry under
`## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-12

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-11` before merge — CI fails the release workflow if the block is
empty.

Categories:

- **Added** — new skills, hooks, gates, or capabilities.
- **Changed** — behavioral changes to existing skills, hooks, or CLI.
- **Fixed** — bug fixes, typo corrections, non-behavioral cleanup.
- **Removed** — skills, hooks, or flags that no longer exist.
- **Migration** — runnable steps needed when upgrading. Use a
  ` ```bash migration ` fenced block for commands `bin/migrate` should execute.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- User validation checkpoints after build and manual-test steps in conductor.
- Backward navigation (`b = go back`) from checkpoints and recovery menu with numbered step menu.
- `stale` state marking (⚠) for downstream steps when revisiting earlier phases.
- `step_satisfied()` gate function — stale steps pass prerequisite checks but re-run when reached.
- Story catalog: 5 product epics and 36 feature stories specifying all harness behavior as Given/When/Then acceptance criteria.
- Design doc for pluggable harness architecture (phased rewrite: stories -> language eval -> conductor rewrite -> skill overrides -> UI abstraction).
- Implementation plan for Phase 1 (story catalog review and acceptance).
- Semver tagging system with CI-driven releases on merge to `main`.

### Changed

- `run_manual_test()` now runs in print mode (automated) instead of interactive mode; harness checkpoint provides user review.
- `run_acceptance_specs()` now runs in print mode (automated) instead of interactive mode.
- Recovery menu expanded from `r/i/s/q` to `r/i/b/s/q` with backward navigation option.
- CLAUDE.md now requires Claude to present VERSION bump for user approval before creating a PR.
- `VERSION` and `CHANGELOG.md` as the source of truth for release cadence.
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` — auto-tag, rewrite changelog, bump version,
  create GitHub Release on every merge to `main`.
- `.github/pull_request_template.md` — scaffolds the Changelog + Migration
  sections for PRs against this repo. Does not affect consumer projects.
- `bin/migrate` — self-configuring migration runner that reads the current
  version from `~/.claude/ai-conductor.config.json`, re-runs
  `bin/install --update`, and executes any `## Migration` bash blocks from the
  changelog entries between the old and new version.
- `bin/install --update` — idempotent refresh path that skips the first-run
  dependency bootstrap and the channel-selection prompt.
- `~/.claude/ai-conductor.config.json` — user-facing config for the update
  channel (`tagged` vs `main`), current version, and auto-check preference.
- `conduct --set-channel {tagged|main}` — switch update channels without
  re-running install.

### Changed

- `check_harness_update()` in `bin/conduct` is channel-aware: on the `tagged`
  channel it checks for the latest `vX.Y.Z` git tag, renders the changelog
  block via `glow` before prompting, and calls `bin/migrate` on approval.
- `HARNESS.md` now documents the update flow in a new "Harness Updates" section.
- `CLAUDE.md` (harness-repo-level) documents the new release and update gates.

### Migration

No migration steps required when upgrading from 0.3.0 — the new update flow
takes effect on the next `conduct` run after this release is installed.

### Fixed

- Feature-level state (manual-test, retro, etc.) no longer bleeds across features in root state file; project-level steps (bootstrap, assess) persist correctly.
- Task progress counter shows correct total from the start (0/10, 1/10) instead of growing denominator (1/1, 2/2).

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-11

Retroactive entry capturing the state of the harness at the point the
versioned release flow was introduced.

### Added

- Full SDLC skill suite: bootstrap, brainstorm, stories, plan,
  architecture-diagram, architecture-review, writing-system-tests, tdd,
  pipeline, code-review, simplify, debugging, manual-test, finish, pr, retro,
  conduct, assess, conflict-check, memory.
- `bin/conduct` orchestrator with phase detection and gate enforcement.
- `bin/install` with symlink-based skill installation, settings.json
  permission/hook wiring, and dependency bootstrap (glow, rtk, puppeteer MCP).
- Hook suite under `hooks/claude/` for destructive-git blocking, TDD commit
  gating, lint-after-edit, spec/diagram coverage, rate-limit handling, session
  start context loading, and stop-memory reminders.
- `test/test_harness_integrity.sh` validation suite covering bash syntax,
  SKILL.md frontmatter, agent references, cross-skill references, HARNESS.md
  model table, template references, and section numbering.
- `HARNESS.md` as the single source of truth for project-facing behavioral
  rules, consumed by every project using the harness.
