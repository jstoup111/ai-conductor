# Writing Acceptance Tests

## Overview

Generate failing acceptance specs from user stories in `docs/stories/*.md`. Each acceptance
criterion (happy AND negative paths) becomes a concrete test. Tests are generated BEFORE
implementation — they are the RED phase of BDD.

**Detects project type and generates the right kind of spec:**

| Project Type | Spec Type | Location | Tests With |
|---|---|---|---|
| API-only (no views) | Integration request specs | `spec/integration/` | HTTP requests, status codes, JSON responses |
| Full-stack (views exist) | System specs | `spec/system/` | Capybara, browser, UI assertions |

## When to Use

Run this **after `/plan` and before `/pipeline`** (or `/tdd`). The flow is:

```
/stories → /conflict-check → /plan → /writing-system-tests → /pipeline
```

**Trigger when:**
- About to implement a feature and stories exist without corresponding acceptance specs
- New story files added to `docs/stories/`
- User asks for acceptance tests, integration tests, BDD tests, or system tests

**Skip when:**
- Acceptance specs already exist for the stories
- Writing unit/model specs (that's the TDD skill's job)

## Process

### 1. Detect Project Type

Check for views/frontend to determine spec type:

- `app/views/` with templates OR `app/javascript/` OR frontend framework → **Full-stack** → system specs
- API-only controllers, no views → **API** → integration request specs

### 2. Check for Missing Acceptance Specs

**API projects:** Compare `docs/stories/*.md` against `spec/integration/*_spec.rb`
**Full-stack:** Compare `docs/stories/*.md` against `spec/system/*_spec.rb`

Generate specs for any story file that lacks a corresponding spec.

**Skip specs for already-tested behavior:** Before generating, check the existing test suite
for overlap. If an acceptance criterion is already covered by existing tests (e.g., unit tests,
request specs, or prior integration specs), do not generate a duplicate spec for it.

**End-to-end, not mocked:** Acceptance specs test the real system. Do NOT mock internal
infrastructure (database, queues, caches, background jobs). Only mock **third-party external
services** (payment APIs, email providers, external webhooks) that are outside the project's
control. If a spec requires infrastructure that isn't available in the test environment,
configure the test environment to provide it — don't mock it away.

### 3. Parse Acceptance Criteria

Extract from each story file:
- Feature area name (H1 or filename)
- Story titles (H2)
- Happy path criteria (Given/When/Then under Happy Path heading)
- Negative path criteria (Given/When/Then under Negative Paths heading)

**Both happy AND negative paths become tests.** Negative paths are not optional.

### 3a. Classify Story Flows

Before generating specs, classify each story:

- **Multi-endpoint flow** (2+ endpoints in the happy path): Generate an integration/acceptance spec.
  Examples: "create a contact then assign tags", "search contacts filtered by tag"
- **Single-endpoint operation** (1 endpoint CRUD): Mark as `request-spec-only` — this story will
  be covered by TDD request specs during implementation. Do NOT generate an acceptance spec for it.
  Examples: "create a contact", "delete a tag", "update a contact's email"

**If ALL stories are single-endpoint (pure CRUD with no multi-step business logic), skip
integration spec generation entirely.** Request specs from TDD will cover all acceptance
criteria. Only generate integration specs when at least one story genuinely crosses 2+ endpoints.

This avoids generating integration specs that duplicate request specs for simple CRUD operations.

### 4. Read App Context

For each story, read the relevant:
- `config/routes.rb` — available routes and path helpers
- Controllers — response formats, auth requirements, before_actions
- Models — validations, associations, enums (for factory setup)
- Existing factories in `spec/factories/` — reuse, don't duplicate

If routes/models don't exist yet (pre-implementation), write tests using the expected paths
from the stories. Tests will fail with `RoutingError` or `ActiveRecord` errors — this is
correct RED behavior.

### 5a. Generate Integration Specs (API Projects)

**File mapping:** `docs/stories/links.md` → `spec/integration/links_spec.rb`

```ruby
RSpec.describe "Link lifecycle", type: :request do
  describe "Story: Create and use a short link" do
    context "happy path" do
      it "creates a link, redirects via short code, and records a click" do
        post "/links", params: { link: { original_url: "https://example.com" } }, headers: auth_headers
        short_code = json_body["link"]["short_code"]
        get "/#{short_code}"
        expect(response).to redirect_to("https://example.com")
      end
    end
    context "negative: expired link" do
      it "returns 410 Gone for an expired link" do
        # create link, travel past expiry, assert :gone
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Key distinction: acceptance specs test FLOWS, not endpoints.**

An acceptance spec that only hits one endpoint is a request spec wearing a costume. If the test
doesn't cross at least 2 endpoints or verify a multi-step story, it belongs in `spec/requests/`
instead.

| Test hits one endpoint | → `spec/requests/` (request spec) |
| Test hits 2+ endpoints in sequence | → `spec/integration/` (acceptance spec) |
| Test verifies model logic directly | → `spec/models/` (unit spec) |

**This avoids duplication.** Request specs own individual endpoint behavior (status codes, error
formats, params validation). Acceptance specs own the story flow (create → use → verify outcome).
Neither duplicates the other.

**Rules for integration specs:**
- Test multi-step flows that map to stories, not individual endpoints
- One `describe` per story, `context` per happy/negative path
- Each test is independent — creates own data via factories
- Assert outcomes, not intermediate HTTP details (request specs own those)
- Auth uses helper methods, not hardcoded tokens
- No mocking external services in integration specs — test the real flow

**Helpers to create if missing:** Create `spec/support/request_helpers.rb` with `json_body` and `auth_headers` helpers if missing.

### 5b. Generate System Specs (Full-Stack Projects)

**File mapping:** `docs/stories/auth.md` → `spec/system/auth_spec.rb`

```ruby
RSpec.describe "Authentication", type: :system do
  before { driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome }

  describe "Story: User Registration" do
    context "happy path" do
      it "registers with valid email and password" do
        visit new_registration_path
        fill_in "Email", with: "user@example.com"
        click_button "Sign Up"
        expect(page).to have_text("Welcome")
      end
    end
    context "negative: duplicate email" do
      it "shows error for existing email" do
        create(:user, email: "taken@example.com")
        visit new_registration_path
        fill_in "Email", with: "taken@example.com"
        click_button "Sign Up"
        expect(page).to have_text("already taken")
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Rules for system specs:**
- Every criterion gets concrete Capybara code — no stubs, no `pending`
- Each test is independent — creates own data, signs in if needed
- No mocking — full stack exercise
- Sign-in uses the actual login form, not a session backdoor
- Use `have_text` for visible content, `have_current_path` for navigation

### 6. Run and Verify RED

```bash
# API projects
bundle exec rspec spec/integration/

# Full-stack projects
bundle exec rspec spec/system/
```

Confirm tests fail for the **right reasons**. This is critical:

**Acceptable pre-implementation failures:**
- `RoutingError`, `NameError`, `UndefinedTable` — infrastructure doesn't exist yet
- `404 Not Found` — endpoint not implemented

**Unacceptable failures (fix the spec):**
- Test passes when it shouldn't, or fails with a wrong error (e.g., `can't be blank` when expecting `not found`)
- Syntax errors or typos in the spec

**A test that fails for the wrong reason is not RED — it's broken.**

### Stubbing Rules for Pre-Implementation Specs

- Stub at system boundaries only: `SecureRandom`, `Time.zone.now`, external API clients, `ENV` values
- Never stub internal methods (private callbacks, service internals) — they don't exist yet and coupling to them breaks on implementation
- Example of correct boundary stub: `allow(SecureRandom).to receive(:alphanumeric).and_return("aaa")`

### 7. Commit the Failing Tests

```bash
git add spec/integration/ spec/support/   # or spec/system/
git commit -m "test: add failing acceptance specs for [feature area]"
```

Failing tests get committed. They represent the acceptance criteria.
Implementation (via `/pipeline` or `/tdd`) makes them pass.

## How This Relates to Other Test Types

```
Acceptance specs (this skill)      — Multi-step story flows across 2+ endpoints
  ↕ generated from docs/stories/     "Create link → visit → verify click recorded"
  ↕ NO single-endpoint tests here

Request specs (TDD per-controller) — Single endpoint HTTP contract
  ↕ generated during RED phase        "POST /links with blank URL returns 422"
  ↕ owns: status codes, error formats, params validation, headers

Unit specs (TDD per-model)         — Model logic in isolation
  ↕ generated during RED phase        "Link.generate_short_code returns 6 chars"
  ↕ owns: validations, callbacks, business methods
```

**Each layer tests something the others don't.** If a test could live in a lower layer, it should.
Acceptance specs are expensive — only use them for multi-step flows that can't be verified at a
lower level. This skill handles the top layer. TDD handles the bottom two.
