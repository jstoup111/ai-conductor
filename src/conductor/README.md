# Conductor (TypeScript)

The TypeScript rewrite of the bash `bin/conduct`. Same CLI surface, richer internals:
typed state machine, event-driven UI, completion-gate checks, engine-side auto-heal for
stale pipeline state, and 545+ tests.

## Key concepts

### State machine

`ALL_STEPS` in `engine/steps.ts` is the canonical ordered list (16 steps across four
phases: UNDERSTAND, DECIDE, SETUP, BUILD, SHIP). `Conductor.run()` resolves the
config-derived registry (`buildStepRegistry(config)` — so YAML **custom steps** run and
are indexed), then walks it: tier-skip → bootstrap-mode-skip → gate → run → verify
completion → recovery.

The **front half** (`worktree`…`acceptance_specs`) is a linear `i++` walk. At `build` it
hands off to the **gate-driven loop** (see below): the *selector*, not the index, chooses
the next step. When `verifyArtifacts` is off the conductor stays fully linear (the gate
loop never engages).

The `acceptance_specs` gate verifies RED specs exist on disk by matching
`STEP_ARTIFACT_GLOBS.acceptance_specs` (`engine/artifacts.ts`). The built-ins cover Rails,
Node, and `backend/` layouts rooted at the repo root. A repo whose specs live elsewhere —
most often a **monorepo** with specs one package deep (`api/spec/…`,
`frontend/__tests__/…`) — declares extra globs via the project-level
`acceptance_spec_globs` config key; they're *appended* to (never replace) the built-ins, so
the gate can only loosen. A leading `*/` in a glob expands to each immediate subdirectory
(skipping `node_modules`/dot-dirs), so package names need not be hard-coded. Config flows to
the check via `CompletionContext.config`.

### Gate-driven loop

Once `build` engages, `advanceTail()` drives
`build → manual_test → prd_audit → architecture_review_as_built → retro → rebase → finish`
by **gate verdicts** instead of a fixed order:

- **Verdicts** — after a gate step runs, its objective verdict is recomputed from on-disk
  evidence (`engine/gate-verdicts.ts`, wrapping `checkGateCompletion`) and persisted to
  `.pipeline/gates/<step>.json` as `{satisfied, reason, checkedAt, kickback?}`. The loop
  owns verdicts; it does not trust an agent's self-report.
- **Selector** (`engine/selector.ts`, `selectNextGate`) — returns the earliest unsatisfied
  gate. A verdict is authoritative over step state; a `stale` step is unsatisfied (must
  re-run).
- **Kickback** — a downstream step can re-open an upstream gate by writing
  `{satisfied:false, kickback.from}` for `plan`/`stories`. `advanceTail` detects it,
  `navigateBack`s (target → pending, downstream → stale), and the selector routes back.
  Capped per gate to prevent ping-pong.
- **Stop** — `.pipeline/DONE` on convergence; `.pipeline/HALT` on the kickback cap, a
  gate selected too many times without satisfying, or **any unexpected throw inside the
  loop** (the error is flushed to state and converted to a HALT so a supervising daemon
  classifies it as `halted` — worktree kept, retryable — never `error` with lost state).
- **Fresh session per step** — with `freshContextPerStep` (daemon/auto only; interactive
  `/conduct` leaves it off so the brainstorm→stories→plan design session keeps its
  context), the LLM session is reset before **every** executed step in the loop
  (Ralph-style; context never bloats across the loop), while a step's own retries resume
  the same session. The reset also fires before the **first** step, which discards any
  stale session inherited from a **reused worktree** — a kept worktree carries the prior
  run's `session-created`/`conduct-session-id`, and without the reset the first step would
  `--resume` a brand-new id that was never created → "session unavailable (expired or in
  use)". `daemon-cli` additionally sweeps those markers on (re)entry as belt-and-suspenders.

The new gate-grade predicates (`plan` = per-path-type story coverage; `stories` = happy +
negative path, no DRAFT) live in `GATE_ONLY_PREDICATES` (`engine/artifacts.ts`), separate
from the linear conductor's completion predicates. See `.docs/decisions/gate-audit-*.md`.

The two SHIP compliance gates — **`prd_audit`** (shipped impl vs the PRD's `FR-N` requirements)
and **`architecture_review_as_built`** (shipped code vs APPROVED ADRs) — sit between
`manual_test` and `retro`. Both are `loopGate: true`, so they inherit the verdict/selector/
kickback machinery above for free. Their objective verdicts come from
`CUSTOM_COMPLETION_PREDICATES`: `prd_audit` stays unsatisfied while any audit-table row carries a
non-`ALIGNED`, un-`ACCEPTED` `FR-N`; `architecture_review_as_built` stays unsatisfied while its
`Verdict:` is `BLOCKED`. An unsatisfied gate keeps the selector from reaching `finish`; the
skill guidance drives where the rework lands (BUILD vs DECIDE for prd-audit; human fix vs
superseding ADR for as-built).

**Daemon prd-audit routing (gap-class aware).** In an interactive run a blocking `prd_audit`
escalates to the recovery menu, where the human picks where to route. In a **daemon** run
(`mode: 'auto'`, `daemon: true`) there is no human, so the conductor routes by the audit's
`Gap-class` column (`classifyPrdAuditGaps`, `engine/artifacts.ts`):

- **Every blocking row is `impl-gap`** → the daemon owns BUILD, so it *self-heals*: emits a
  `kickback` (`prd_audit → build`), `navigateBack`s to `build`, rebuilds, and re-audits. This is
  bounded by `prdAuditSelfHeals` (cap `MAX_KICKBACKS_PER_GATE`); if the gap still isn't closed it
  writes `.pipeline/HALT` (`impl-gap unresolved after N build attempts`).
- **Any blocking row is a product/plan gap** (`intended-drift`, or an unclassifiable row)
  → closing it needs a human DECIDE amendment the daemon can't run (DECIDE steps are pre-seeded
  `done`), so it HALTs immediately (`product/plan gap needs human DECIDE`).

Re-auditing unchanged code yields the same verdict, so the daemon skips the default per-step
retries for a blocking `prd_audit` and routes straight away.

### Rebase-on-latest (before finish)

The `rebase` step is an **engine-native** loopGate (like `complexity` — no Claude dispatch;
the engine runs it in `Conductor.runRebaseStep`, helpers in `engine/rebase.ts`). It runs
after `build`+`manual_test` are satisfied and before `finish`, so a PR is never built on a
stale base:

- **Base discovery** — origin's default branch via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`
  (fetched), falling back to the **local** base when there's no origin or the fetch fails.
  No literal `main`/`master`.
- **Verdict = branch current with base** — *satisfied ⇔ zero commits in `HEAD..base`*. A
  no-op rebase is the satisfied state, so re-entry after a kickback finds the branch current
  and proceeds to `finish` without re-invalidating (no false `MAX_GATE_SELECTIONS` HALT). A
  genuinely stale branch is never satisfied.
- **Invalidation (code/test only)** — a clean rebase that changed **code/test paths** writes
  `{satisfied:false, kickback:{from:'rebase'}}` for `build` (+`manual_test` if it ran) via the
  existing kickback machinery → the selector routes back to `build`. A **docs-only /
  CHANGELOG-only** change does **not** invalidate.
- **CHANGELOG auto-resolve** — when `CHANGELOG.md` is the **sole** conflict and it's inside
  `## [Unreleased]`, the resolver takes the base's merged entries and re-appends this
  feature's `[Unreleased]` lines (captured `base..HEAD` pre-rebase) exactly once, then
  `git rebase --continue`s. CHANGELOG conflicting alongside any other file, or outside
  `[Unreleased]`, takes the HALT path instead.
- **Conflict → HALT (paused)** — any other / mixed conflict writes `.pipeline/HALT` listing
  the conflicted files and the resume steps, leaves the rebase **paused** (no `--abort`,
  conflict markers intact), does **not** mark the feature processed, and opens **no PR**.
- **Events** — each outcome emits a typed event: `rebase_noop`, `rebase_changed`,
  `rebase_changelog_resolved`, `rebase_conflict_halt` (best-effort; emission failure never
  affects the rebase result).

**Resume a parked rebase:** resolve the conflict in the listed file(s) → `git rebase --continue`
→ `rm .pipeline/HALT` → re-queue. The daemon reuses the existing worktree, finds the rebase a
no-op (branch now current), and converges to the PR. If you clear HALT without finishing the
rebase, the daemon detects the still-stale/in-progress state and re-parks rather than shipping
a half-rebased branch.

### Daemon mode

`conduct-ts daemon` (`daemon-cli.ts`) drains a backlog of features that already have
human-authored stories **and** plans, running each in its own worktree via the gate loop
and opening a PR on finish:

- `engine/daemon.ts` (`runDaemon`) — parallel worker pool (`--concurrency N`), hard
  ceilings (`--max-items`, `--max-cost`, `--max-runtime`), `once` vs `--continuous`
  idle-poll, and per-feature failure isolation (a thrown feature becomes an `error`
  outcome; the pool survives).
- `engine/daemon-backlog.ts` — eligibility, sourced from the **local default branch kept
  current with origin between work**. Discovery is local-first: the pool calls `discoverBacklog`
  with `refresh:false` (no fetch) while features are in flight or local queued work remains,
  and only when it is **fully idle with nothing left locally** does it pass `refresh:true` —
  "drained → find more". On that idle refresh, `fastForwardRoot` does a **safe**
  `git merge --ff-only origin/<default>` of the daemon's root checkout (default branch discovered
  via `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, never hardcoded) — only when the root is on
  the default branch with a clean working tree; otherwise it logs a warning and **skips** (never
  clobbering operator state). Because the fast-forward happens only between work, an in-flight
  build is never advanced onto specs that merged on origin mid-run, and worktree checkouts (separate
  working trees) are never touched. `discoverBacklog` then reads `.docs/plans` + `.docs/stories`
  from `git show <default>:…` on that now-current local branch. This is what makes **merging the
  spec PR the build-ready trigger** (FR-24): a spec the engineer authored but has not landed, or
  one committed only on an unmerged `spec/<slug>` branch, is invisible until it reaches the
  default branch. Each worktree is cut from this fresh branch, so the vetted stories+plan already
  physically exist in it — there is **no separate spec-copy/materialization step**. `fastForwardRoot`
  degrades gracefully and never throws: no origin, unset `origin/HEAD`, a dirty tree, a failed
  fetch (offline), or a non-fast-forward (divergence) all leave the local branch as-is and the
  poll loop continues. On top of
  feature must have stories **approved** (`Status: Accepted`, not DRAFT — a stories file with
  no status line counts as **not approved**) + a plan that declares a **dependency tree**
  (`## Task Dependency Graph` or per-task `**Dependencies:**`), and not yet be processed.
  The approval token is the single shared `isStoriesApproved` (`engine/artifacts.ts`), also
  enforced at land time by the engineer (`land-spec.ts` / `authoring.ts` reject stories
  lacking `Status: Accepted`) — so a spec can never land in a state the daemon then skips.
  Ineligible features are skipped with a logged reason; because every skip here is for a
  **merged** spec that can never build, the reason is surfaced **once per slug**
  (`.daemon/warned/<slug>` markers) rather than re-logged on every poll tick — the daemon
  pre-seeds the front half, so eligibility is the only place specs are vetted before
  autonomous build.
- `engine/daemon-runner.ts` — per-feature discipline: done → mark + remove worktree + PR;
  halted/error → keep the worktree for the human. On completion it also emits a engineer
  signal (see below).
- `engine/daemon-deps.ts` — concrete git/fs primitives (worktree add/remove off the
  fast-forwarded default branch, `.pipeline/DONE`/`HALT` outcome read).
- `engine/worktree-prepare.ts` — writes `WORKTREE_NAMESPACE` + runs the project's `bin/setup` (see below).
- `engine/daemon-dashboard.ts`, `engine/daemon-sha.ts`, `engine/daemon-rekick.ts` —
  halt-reconciliation: startup dashboard, base-SHA tracking, main-advance re-kick (below).

The daemon consumes specs — it never authors them. `--continuous` idle-polls for new
eligible features, bounded by the ceilings.

#### Halt-reconciliation: startup dashboard + main-advance re-kick (ADR-013)

PR #109 made the durable `.pipeline/HALT` marker authoritative at discovery, so a parked
feature stays parked across restarts until a human clears it. Halt-reconciliation adds two
things on top of that, without a parallel dispatch path:

- **Startup inherited-state dashboard (`daemon-dashboard.ts`).** Before any dispatch, the
  daemon scans `.worktrees/*/` (`.pipeline/HALT`, `conduct-state.json`) and the
  `.daemon/processed/` ledger and prints one grouped dashboard to **both** stdout and
  `daemon.log` — four groups with precedence **HALTED > PROCESSED > IN-PROGRESS > ELIGIBLE**:
  HALTED (slug + first line of the HALT reason), IN-PROGRESS (slug + last meaningful step
  from `conduct-state`), ELIGIBLE (build-ready slugs this scan that are neither halted nor
  processed), PROCESSED (count). Best-effort: an empty HALT → reason `unknown`, a malformed
  `conduct-state` → step `unknown`, a per-worktree fs error is skipped — the scan never
  aborts startup.

- **Base-SHA tracking + re-kick (`daemon-sha.ts`, `daemon-rekick.ts`).** The daemon
  `git rev-parse`s the local default branch (fast-forwarded to origin on idle refresh by
  `fastForwardRoot`, never a hardcoded branch) and persists the last-seen value to **`.daemon/last-base-sha`**
  (empty / garbage / non-40-hex / unreadable → treated as **absent**, never a spurious
  advance). On a **genuine base-SHA advance** — observed live on an idle refresh, or at
  startup versus the persisted value (a base that moved while the daemon was **down**) — it
  runs a **re-kick sweep** over every halted worktree: log the reason → if a 9.0 rebase is
  paused, `git rebase --abort` (a **failed** abort leaves the marker intact, no half-clear) →
  rename `.pipeline/HALT` → **`.pipeline/HALT.cleared`** (reason preserved) → remove
  `.pipeline/HALT` → drop a **`.pipeline/REKICK`** sentinel. The sweep issues **no dispatch**;
  clearing the marker lets PR #109's un-park path re-dispatch the feature on the next poll. A
  per-feature **last-rekick SHA** bounds it (a same-SHA re-halt is not re-kicked again; only a
  further advance re-kicks). **First run** (no persisted SHA) initializes without re-kicking,
  and a plain **restart with no advance** honors every marker exactly as PR #109 does.

- **Resume rebase-first (FR-12).** On re-dispatch, `runConductorInWorktree` sees the
  `.pipeline/REKICK` sentinel and runs 9.0's **rebase-onto-latest first** (reusing
  `engine/rebase.ts`), then deletes the sentinel (one-shot), so the pending gate (e.g.
  `prd_audit`) re-verifies against the **advanced base** rather than the stale one. If the
  rebase re-conflicts on the new base, the feature re-parks via 9.0's existing HALT path
  (bounded by the same last-rekick SHA); residual gaps route through the normal gate loop /
  `/remediate`, not the re-kick code.

#### Worktree preparation (`WORKTREE_NAMESPACE` + `bin/setup`)

The daemon is **stack-agnostic**: it knows nothing about Docker, Postgres, or Redis. But an
autonomous worktree build still needs its dependencies installed and a database it won't
collide with when two worktrees run concurrently. Worktree creation is the daemon's job, so
the per-worktree *identity* that flows from it is too — and the daemon establishes it in one
place, then defers everything stack-specific to the project's standard setup script:

> After cutting the worktree and **before** building, the runner (1) writes
> `WORKTREE_NAMESPACE=<worktree>` into the worktree's `.env`, then (2) runs the project's
> conventional `bin/setup` with `CI=true` and `WORKTREE_NAMESPACE` exported, if one exists.
> No `bin/setup` → the namespace is still written, then no-op.

`makeRunFeature` calls `deps.prepareWorktree` between `createWorktree` and `runConductor`;
the concrete dep (`worktree-prepare.ts`) runs `bin/setup` with the **worktree as cwd**. The
project's normal config consumes `WORKTREE_NAMESPACE` — e.g. a Rails `database.yml` builds
`app_<env>_<namespace>` and `bin/setup`'s `db:prepare` creates it; there is no second,
daemon-only setup path to drift. `CI=true` lets setup scripts skip interactive steps such as
starting a dev server (`bin/dev` belongs to the later manual-test phase, not the build).

Why reuse `bin/setup` rather than a bespoke daemon script: the daemon runs exactly what a
human / CI runs, so dependency install + DB prepare stay in one idempotent place. A project
that translates the namespace differently (Python, etc.) just does so inside its own
`bin/setup`.

Failure discipline: a non-zero exit from `bin/setup` (or a present-but-non-executable script)
**throws**, which `makeRunFeature` treats like any primitive throw — worktree kept, feature
reported `error` — so the daemon never builds against a half-prepared environment. Projects
that need no setup (a static site, a pure library) simply ship no `bin/setup` and are
untouched. This is what lets one daemon serve **any** project setup, including consumer
projects that use the harness.

#### PR labeling (`needs-remediation` + `mergeable`, daemon-only)

Two GitHub labels give a human operator an at-a-glance signal on the daemon's PRs without
reading logs or opening worktrees.

**`needs-remediation` draft PR (irrecoverable build failure)**

When the gate loop writes `.pipeline/HALT` on an irrecoverable BUILD failure *and* the
feature branch has at least one commit, the daemon (via `daemon-runner.ts`) pushes the
branch and surfaces a **draft** PR labeled `needs-remediation` with a comment that includes
the failure reason and the relevant error. The PR is draft so it cannot be merged accidentally.
If an open PR already exists for the branch it is reused (label + comment applied, no
duplicate opened). When the branch has **zero commits** no PR, comment, or label is
produced — the existing local HALT marker is the only surface, unchanged. All GitHub
side-effects are **best-effort and non-blocking**: a push, PR-create, comment, or label
failure is logged and swallowed; the HALT is still written regardless. This behavior is
**distinct** from the engineer intake `needs-manual` ledger state, which tracks intake-issue
re-eligibility and is unrelated to build-failure PR labeling.

When a feature that previously produced a `needs-remediation` PR is later re-dispatched and
reaches `done`, the daemon clears the stale signal: it removes the `needs-remediation` label
and un-drafts the PR (best-effort) before enrolling it in the `mergeable` sweep (FR-16), so
the now-clean PR is not permanently barred from `mergeable` and the label does not lie.

**`mergeable` label sweep (fully-shipped PRs)**

When a feature reaches `done`, its PR is enrolled in a per-repo watch registry
(`.daemon/mergeable-watch.jsonl`). A best-effort sweep — run on daemon startup, after each
feature completes, and on each idle poll tick — evaluates every enrolled PR and keeps the
`mergeable` label in sync with reality:

- **Added** when: the PR is open, has no merge conflicts, and CI is passing (a PR with no
  required checks counts as passing).
- **Removed** when: the PR becomes non-mergeable (new conflicts, CI breaks, or no longer open).
- **Pruned** when: the PR is merged or closed (dropped from the registry, no further activity).

A PR carrying `needs-remediation` is **never** labeled `mergeable`. The sweep is best-effort
and non-blocking: a label-read or apply/remove failure is logged and does not disrupt feature
processing. Because CI typically finishes after the PR is opened, the sweep re-checks over
time rather than making a one-shot determination at PR creation.

### Daemon observability (`status` / `logs`)

The daemon is spawned **detached** (`engine/engineer/daemon-launch.ts`,
`stdio:'ignore'`), so its console output is discarded. To keep *activity* visible — not
just liveness — `runDaemonMode` tees its log sink into an append-only
**`.daemon/daemon.log`** (`engine/daemon-log.ts`, opened once the per-repo pidfile lock is
held). Because `renderDaemonEvent` and every feature start/finish line already route
through that one sink, the file captures the full BUILD narrative: feature start, each
gate-loop step result (`step_completed` / unsatisfied `gate_verdict` / `kickback` /
`loop_halt`), and finish (`shipped`/`failed` + PR url). The log is size-capped (~1 MB,
rotated once to `daemon.log.1`).

Two **read-only** sub-subcommands of `daemon` (`engine/daemon-observe-cli.ts`,
dispatched before the pipeline boots and **before** the `daemon` run command, so
`status`/`logs` are never mistaken for a daemon launch — `detectDaemonCommand` in
`daemon-command.ts` yields when argv[3] is `status`/`logs`) surface it:

- **`conduct-ts daemon status`** — iterate the project registry and, for each repo,
  report pidfile liveness via the `daemon-lock.ts` primitives (`readPidRecord` + `isLive`):
  `running` (owner alive), `stale` (owner dead — reclaimable), `stopped` (no pidfile),
  plus pid, start time, and the last log line. A registered path that no longer exists is
  reported as `path missing`; a single bad repo never aborts the sweep.
- **`conduct-ts daemon logs [--repo <path>] [--follow] [--all]`** — print (or `--follow`,
  `tail -f` semantics) `.daemon/daemon.log` for one repo (default: cwd) or every registered
  repo (`--all`). A missing log prints a friendly note rather than erroring.

See `test/engine/daemon-log.test.ts` and `test/engine/daemon-observe-cli.test.ts`. The
pidfile path and the O_EXCL create flag stay confined to `daemon-lock.ts`
(`test/engine/daemon-lock-boundary.test.ts`); the log module reuses the exported
`daemonDir()` and never re-encodes the pidfile.

### Engineer memory store (Phase 9.1)

On **daemon** feature completion (`done`/`halted`), the runner emits a structured learning
signal + a narrative to a cross-project store at `~/.ai-conductor/engineer/` (override with
`$AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR`; the dir is auto-created). The store lives outside any repo so
daemon-built repos stay free of retro clutter. `engine/engineer-store.ts` owns it:

- `signals.jsonl` — append-only, **one JSON line per feature-run**. Each line is a
  `EngineerSignal`:
  `{schemaVersion, ts, project, feature, runId, outcome, kickbacks[], halts[],
  retryHotspots[], tokens{input,output,cacheRead,cacheCreation}, durationByStep{},
  narrativeRef?}`. Empty signal categories serialize as `[]`; `narrativeRef` is optional
  (absent when a complexity tier skipped the retro). Fields are assembled from the
  feature's `.pipeline/events.jsonl` (reusing `report-renderer` aggregation) + the
  `FeatureOutcome` — no new loop instrumentation.
- `narratives/<project>/<feature>-<runId>.md` — the narrative, keyed by `runId` so re-runs
  never overwrite a prior one. `done` → a full retro via the LLM provider; `halted` → a
  short halt note (gate + reason, no LLM call).

**Daemon retro redirect (ADR-002 Option A):** under the daemon the in-loop `retro` step is
**skipped** — the emission step owns narrative production into the engineer store instead of
writing `.docs/retros/` into the feature repo. Manual `/conduct` runs are unaffected and
still write repo retros. Emission is **best-effort**: every store error is logged and
swallowed, and the append is a single atomic `O_APPEND` write so concurrent worker
emissions never tear the log. A write failure can never break a ship.

### Events

`ConductorEvent` in `types/events.ts` is a discriminated union of all events the engine
emits. UIs subscribe via `ConductorEventEmitter`. Events include `step_started`,
`step_completed`, `step_failed`, `step_retry`, `checkpoint_reached`, `recovery_needed`,
`rate_limit`, `session_reset`, `auto_heal`, `mode_skip`, `feature_complete`, etc.

Gate-loop events: `gate_verdict` (a gate's verdict was (re)computed), `kickback` (a step
re-opened an upstream gate, with reason + count), `loop_halt` (the loop stopped without
converging), and `loop_converged`. `TerminalRenderer` surfaces them; the json-stdout
subscriber serializes them generically.

The contract is additive — new event types may be introduced without breaking existing
subscribers. Subscribers receive only events they register for via `emitter.on(type, ...)`.

### Bootstrap-mode skip

`state.bootstrap_mode` is set by the `bootstrap` skill to one of `new`, `fresh`,
`partial`, `re-bootstrap`. When `new`, the conductor skips `assess` via
`shouldSkipForBootstrapMode()` — the 9 CTO specialists have nothing to review on a
freshly-scaffolded directory. All other modes run `assess` normally.

### Auto-heal

`engine/autoheal.ts` handles drift between `.pipeline/task-status.json` and the git log
that can accumulate after a crashed pipeline run. Before re-invoking the build step on
a completion-gate retry, the conductor runs auto-heal once per session:

1. Read task-status.json (shape-preserving — either array or id-keyed map).
2. Compute commit range: `git merge-base origin/main HEAD..HEAD` (fallback `HEAD~100`).
3. For each pending task, require both a commit-message match (`T<id>`, `#<id>`, or
   case-insensitive name substring — word-boundary for names <12 chars) AND a file-path
   overlap with the plan's per-task file list.
4. Healed tasks are flipped to `completed` in place; an audit record is written to
   `.pipeline/audit-trail/autoheal-<ISO>.json`.
5. Conductor re-runs `checkStepCompletion`; if passing, proceeds without invoking Claude.

See `engine/autoheal.ts` for the heuristic and `test/engine/conductor.test.ts` for the
six auto-heal test scenarios.

### Pinned Node

`.tool-versions` pins `nodejs 20.19.0`. The bundle targets `node20` — older Node throws
on execa's `addAbortListener` import. `bin/conduct-ts` reads this file and exports
`ASDF_NODEJS_VERSION` so the conductor runs on its required Node even if the user's
shell default is older.

### Project registry (`register` / `create`)

`engine/registry.ts` is the **single writer** for the harness project registry at
`~/.ai-conductor/registry.json` (override with `$AI_CONDUCTOR_REGISTRY`; `resolveRegistryPath`
is injectable, mirroring `engine/user-config.ts`). Per ADR-003 all three entry points
(`conduct-ts register`, `conduct-ts create`, `/bootstrap`) funnel through it so correctness lives in
one place:

- **Atomic writes** — serialize the whole registry to a unique temp sibling, then `rename` over
  the target (POSIX-atomic; readers never see a partial file, concurrency-safe).
- **Canonical-path dedup** — `upsertProject` keys records by `realpath`-canonicalized absolute
  path, so symlinked/relative aliases of the same repo collapse to one record. For a not-yet-
  existing `create` target it canonicalizes the parent then rejoins the leaf.
- **Status provenance** — an upsert never downgrades a `created` record to `registered`.
- **Credential redaction** — `redactRemote` strips `user:token@` from `https://`/`ssh://` URLs
  (scp-form `git@host:path` is left intact — it carries no secret) before any write.
- **Reported failures** — register/create surface a registry write failure as a non-zero exit,
  never swallowed (contrast the engineer store's best-effort emission).
- **Malformed registry** — `readRegistry` returns `[]` for an absent file but **throws** on
  invalid JSON; a corrupt registry is surfaced, not masked as empty.

`engine/registry-cli.ts` holds the two non-interactive handlers, dispatched from `index.ts`
(`detectRegistryCommand`) **before** the interactive pipeline boots:

- `conduct-ts register [path]` (default cwd) — validate the path is an existing git repo (else
  non-zero exit + clear stderr, registry byte-unchanged), derive the record (name=basename,
  absolute path, redacted `git remote get-url origin` if present), upsert with `status: registered`.
- `conduct-ts create <name> [--remote <url>]` — no-clobber guard (a non-empty target writes nothing),
  else `git init` + skeleton `CLAUDE.md` (references HARNESS.md) + `.gitignore` (`.pipeline/`,
  `.daemon/`, `.worktrees/`) + `git remote add origin` when `--remote` is given (add-only, no
  push), upsert with `status: created`.

`ProjectRecord` and the registry **read-side** (`createRegistryReader`) are now consumed by the
engineer supervisor (Phase 9.3, below). See `test/engine/registry.test.ts` and
`test/integration/registry-cli.test.ts`.

### Engineer mode (agent-hosted, Phase 9.3)

The engineer turns a free-form idea into a routed, lesson-informed spec **PR**, and **never builds
and never merges** — a merged spec PR is the only idea→build handoff. As of Phase 9.3 it is an
**agent-hosted, in-chat, human-gated DECIDE loop**: the host agent drives routing and the real
DECIDE skills directly. There is **no Node readline REPL** and **no spawned `claude -p`** — the
TypeScript layer (`engine/engineer/`) supplies deterministic primitives (routing, authoring guard,
intake parsing, liveness) that the host agent calls between human gates. The no-build/no-merge
guarantee is enforced structurally by `test/engine/engineer/non-autonomy.test.ts` (the engineer
source tree imports no build/pipeline entry point and issues no `gh pr merge`) and by
`summary.buildsRun` staying `0`.

**Starting it.** Run the bare **`conduct-ts engineer`** command: it launches an interactive
`claude /engineer` session (stdio inherited) and drops you straight into the loop. This is the
agent-hosted front door — an *operator-driven* interactive session, distinct from the removed
headless `claude -p` automation. The session is launched with `--permission-mode default` (never
`plan`) so the engineer can author DECIDE artifacts, create the spec branch, and run `land`/`handoff`
even if your global `defaultMode` is `plan`; set `CONDUCT_ENGINEER_PERMISSION_MODE` (e.g.
`acceptEdits`, `bypassPermissions`) to change it (`plan` is coerced back to `default`). Run from
inside an existing Claude Code session, it instead tells you to invoke `/engineer` directly (no
nested session); with `claude` not on `PATH` it prints usage.
The `conduct-ts engineer projects | claim | land | handoff | poll | forget` subcommands are the
deterministic primitives the skill calls between human gates (`claim`/`poll`/`forget` drive the
Phase 9.3b github-issues intake — see below). `land`/`handoff` accept an optional `--source-ref
<owner/repo#N>` so an intake-originated idea reports back to its issue. The bare launcher also
accepts an idea directly: `conduct-ts engineer "<idea>"` (or `--idea "<idea>"`) drives one specific
idea and skips the intake poll.

Per idea (each isolated so one repo's failure never corrupts another):

1. **Intake (hexagonal port)** — ideas arrive as a parsed `Envelope`
   (`{id, source, sourceRef, text, hintRepo?, status, receivedAt}`) through `engine/engineer/intake/`.
   `parseEnvelope` is parse-don't-validate with **field-named** errors; empty/whitespace text is
   **rejected** (`EmptyEnvelopeTextError`), never silently dropped. Two adapters ship behind the same
   port: the synchronous `claude-session` adapter and the async **`github-issues`** adapter
   (Phase 9.3b, below). Dedup is the durable **intake ledger** (`intake/ledger.ts`) keyed strictly on
   `(source, sourceRef)`, never on text — it is the **sole** dedup authority (the old in-memory guard
   was removed in 9.3b; cross-repo same-number issues and re-filed-under-a-new-number ideas are
   correctly distinct).
2. **Route** — `routeIdea` (`engine/engineer/routing.ts`) ranks registry projects against the idea
   and returns candidates (or a create-suggestion when nothing fits).
3. **Confirmation gate** (human-in-the-loop, mandatory before any write) — confirm the target;
   decline with **zero writes** (no branch, no PR, no gh call); `redirect <name>` retargets to
   another registered project (unknown name → re-prompted, no invented path); `create <path>`
   (offered on no-fit) scaffolds + registers a new repo through the 9.2 `create` path. Multi-repo
   **fan-out** authors each confirmed target independently; a deselected repo is left untouched.
4. **Select lessons** — `selectLessons` (`engine/engineer/lesson-store.ts`) pulls prior lessons
   relevant to the target from the engineer store and injects the digest into the authoring prompt
   (no relevant lessons → an explicit empty digest, not unrelated padding).
5. **Author (real DECIDE seam)** — `runAuthoring(target, idea, deps)` (`engine/engineer/authoring.ts`)
   runs the **full DECIDE phase** in canonical order — brainstorm → complexity → stories →
   conflict-check → architecture-diagram → architecture-review → plan — behind `decide` +
   `assessComplexity` seams; any unapproved step (or a DRAFT ADR) **throws and fabricates nothing**.
   The complexity tier gates the middle three (Small skips conflict-check + architecture) and is
   persisted to `.docs/complexity/<slug>.md` so the daemon can consume it. On approval it writes
   `Status: Accepted` stories + a plan dependency tree on a `spec/<slug>` branch off the **derived**
   default branch (never hardcoded `main`), artifacts under `.docs/` only. It never emits the old
   `_Generated by engineer._` stub,
   never a DRAFT story, and never spawns `claude` to author. All writes pass through
   `AuthoringGuard.assertWriteAllowed` (`engine/engineer/authoring-guard.ts`), which rejects `..`,
   absolute-sibling, and prefix-collision paths with `PathEscapeError` — authoring repo A leaves
   sibling repo B byte-for-byte unchanged, and a stale/missing target path fails fast with
   `TargetPathMissingError` (never a cwd fallback).
6. **Handoff** — the loop opens a spec **PR** (`gh pr create`, never `merge`) and records the
   authored-keys ledger. A target with **no remote** is non-fatal: the spec stays committed on the
   branch and the ledger is still recorded so the FR-12 flywheel trend counts the feature. After the
   spec lands, `ensureRunning` is wired (see below) to bring up the target's daemon.

#### GitHub-issues intake + write-back (Phase 9.3b)

The **`github-issues`** adapter (`intake/github-issues.ts`) turns assigned GitHub issues into the same
`Envelope`s the chat path produces, then reports progress back to the issue. All GitHub access goes
through an injected `gh` runner — it never touches a registered repo's working tree.

- **Capture is assignee-based.** `conduct-ts engineer poll` sweeps every registered repo for open
  issues assigned to the authenticated user (`gh issue list --assignee @me --state open`), enqueues
  new ones into the durable inbox (`<engineer-dir>/inbox/`, one claimable `Envelope` per file), and
  exits — **no routing, no processing, no background timer**. A failing repo (auth/availability) is
  isolated and the rest still capture; an empty issue (no title and no body) is skipped. The ledger
  dedups, so polling twice enqueues nothing new.
- **The `engineer:handled` label is an output marker, not an intake filter.** It is applied on `done`
  (auto-created if missing) and makes the issue a re-capture skip; capture itself stays assignee-based.
- **Poll-on-launch (live path).** The bare `conduct-ts engineer` launcher **pre-polls** github issues
  and enqueues new ones into the inbox *before* spawning the interactive `claude /engineer` session
  (printing `Intake: N issue(s) queued.`), then the session's step 1 runs `conduct-ts engineer claim`
  to atomically dequeue the **oldest** idea (claim+ack removes it from the inbox; the ledger advances
  to `claimed`). An empty inbox → the skill falls back to a CLI-supplied idea or chat capture. A
  CLI-supplied idea skips the pre-poll for that session. The pre-poll is best-effort — a `gh` failure
  never blocks the launch. (The legacy `runEngineerMode` loop in `intake/loop.ts` carries an
  equivalent in-process poll→claim→process block, but it is a **test-only** scripted harness — the
  live launch path is the pre-poll + `claim` seam described here.)
- **Write-back (`report()`)** posts `Routed to <repo>` at routing and `Spec PR opened: <url>` at
  handoff, applying `engineer:handled` on done. The skill threads it through the `--source-ref` flag
  on `land` (routed) and `handoff` (done); the shared `intake/writeback.ts` helper backs both the CLI
  primitives and the test-only loop. It is **non-fatal** (a `gh` outage never reverts a delivered spec
  PR) and **de-duplicated** per `(sourceRef, status)`.
- **Re-eligibility + churn guard.** A `done` issue whose spec PR closes **without merging** is
  re-emitted on the next poll (label stripped, `attempts++`); a **merged** PR is never reopened. Past
  the reopen cap the issue is parked as `needs-manual` and stays out of the inbox until
  `conduct-ts engineer forget <owner/repo#N>` drops its ledger entry and strips the label.

State lives under the engineer dir (`$AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR`, default `~/.ai-conductor/engineer/`):
`ledger.json` (dedup + lifecycle) and `inbox/` (the claimable queue).

#### Daemon liveness (pidfile-lock)

`engine/engineer/daemon-lock.ts` owns a **one-per-repo mutex**: `.daemon/daemon.pid` is created with
`O_EXCL` so exactly one daemon wins under concurrent boots. Liveness is `process.kill(pid, 0)`
(`ESRCH` → dead, `EPERM` → alive); a corrupt/malformed pidfile is treated as absent. Stale reclaim
**never permanently refuses** — a `kill -9` leftover is reclaimed on the next boot.
`ensureRunning(repoPath, deps)` spawns a detached daemon **iff** none is live or the pidfile is
stale, no-ops if one is already alive, and **never manages** the lifecycle (fire-and-forget;
ensure-not-manage). `launchDaemonDetached` launches with `cwd: repoPath` (was passing `--project`),
so the pidfile and worktree land under the target repo's `.daemon/`. The registry `daemonState`
mirror is **non-authoritative** — the pidfile wins; a mirror-write failure is non-fatal.

Read-only reporting over the engineer store ships as library functions: `governorReport`
(`engine/engineer/governor.ts`) aggregates spend + kickback/halt/retry rates; `computeFlywheelTrend`
(`engine/engineer/flywheel-trend.ts`) reports `improving` / `insufficient_data` across
engineer-planned features (store ∩ authored-keys ledger). Registry/store paths come from
`$AI_CONDUCTOR_REGISTRY` / `$AI_CONDUCTOR_ENGINEER_DIR`. Acceptance scenarios live in
`test/acceptance/engineer.test.ts`.

## Testing pattern

- **Unit tests** live next to the module under test (e.g. `test/engine/autoheal.test.ts`
  mirrors `src/engine/autoheal.ts`).
- **Integration tests** live under `test/integration/` and drive the Conductor end-to-end
  with mocked runners.
- `execa` is mocked globally per test file via `vi.mock('execa', () => ({ execa: vi.fn() }))`
  where the tested code invokes git or other subprocesses.
- Temp directories: `mkdtemp(join(tmpdir(), 'conductor-<name>-'))` + `rm({ recursive,
  force })` in `afterEach`.

## Baseline

504 passing / 41 failing at the start of the Fix A/B/C + phase-5 UI work. Each commit
preserves or raises the passing count without adding to the failure set (see CHANGELOG
under `[Unreleased]`).
